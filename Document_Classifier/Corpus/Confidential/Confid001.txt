By means of resolution no. 17221 dated 12 March 2010 – amended by subsequent resolution no. 17389 dated
23 June 2010 – Consob approved Regulations containing provisions on related-party transactions. The new
legislation disciplines the procedures to be followed for the approval of the transactions entered into by listed
companies and issuers having shares held by the general public with parties in potential conflict of interest,
including the reference or controlling shareholders, members of the administrative and control bodies and top
executives, including their close family members.
Within the sphere of the Group, the legislation in question applies to UBI Banca and to Banco di San
Giorgio, since it is a company with shares held by the general public.
In relation to this, the competent bodies of the aforementioned companies approved their own regulations,
within the envisaged timescales, which discipline related-party transactions, and internal processes suitable
for ensuring observance of the new rules issued were defined.
With specific reference to UBI Banca, the Supervisory Board took steps to appoint, internally, a Related
Parties Committee to which transactions falling within the sphere of application of the provisions must be
submitted in advance.
Furthermore, in compliance with the indications provided by Consob, it has also been envisaged that UBI
Banca transactions with related parties carried out by subsidiaries also be subject to the regulations in
question if, by virtue of the provisions of the Corporate By-Laws or internal procedures adopted by UBI
Banca, the Management Board, the Supervisory Board upon the proposal of the Management Board or also a
representative of the Issuer by virtue of the authority granted the same, must examine or approve a
transaction to be carried out by subsidiaries in advance.
For further information please refer to the matters described in Section One, Chapter XVI, Paragraph 16.4
and Chapter XIX of the Prospectus.

Subscription commitments
On 28 March 2011, Mediobanca signed a pre-guarantee agreement undertaking to guarantee – under the
usual terms and conditions for this type of transaction and up to a total maximum amount of Euro 1 billion –
the underwriting of UBI Shares in an amount corresponding to any Option Rights that might not be exercised
upon the conclusion of the Market Offer.
Under the Offer, Mediobanca and Centrobanca (the latter without taking on any guarantee commitments)
will act as Joint Global Coordinators. Mediobanca will also act as bookrunner. The market will be informed
of any potential participation of other financial institutions in the guarantee syndicate coordinated and led by
Mediobanca and Centrobanca, together with their respective roles, by means of a press release.
The guarantee agreement, which will be concluded prior to the launch of the Offer, will be drawn up in
accordance with market practice and will contain a commitment by the financial institutions participating in
the guarantee syndicate (the “Guarantors”) to underwrite the UBI Shares in an amount corresponding to
those Option Rights that might not be exercised upon the conclusion of the Market Offer up to a maximum 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
34
amount of Euro 1 billion, along with the usual clauses stipulating conditions for the guarantee commitment
to have effect or giving Mediobanca the right to revoke the Guarantors’ guarantee commitment upon the
occurrence, inter alia, of events which may prejudice the proper conclusion of the Offer (so-called “material
adverse change” or “force majeure”) or upon the occurrence of serious violations by the Company of
commitments made or guarantees given in the guarantee agreement.
The agreement undertaken will be notified to the market by means of a press release.
Dilutive effects of the Capital Increase
The UBI Shares are offered under option to all the Issuer’s shareholders and all the Bondholders and,
therefore, there are no dilutive effects in terms of percentage stake in the Issuer’s fully diluted share capital
(calculated assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds and full subscription of the Capital Increase)
vis-à-vis the Issuer’s shareholders and the Bondholders who decide to subscribe to the Offer to the extent of
their entitlement. On the other hand, with reference to the percentage stake in the actually issued share
capital, the shareholders who decide to subscribe to the Offer for their entire entitlement, shall in any event
experience a maximum dilution of 2.12% should all or part of the Bondholders decide to subscribe to the
Option Rights assigned to them.
The Issuer’s shareholders who by contrast decide not to subscribe the Offer for the portion they are entitled
to, could see their stake in the actually issued capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around 29.12%.
On the other hand, considering the stake in the fully diluted capital (calculated, with reference to the situation
prior to the Offer, assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the basis of the current conversion
ratio and, with reference to the post-Offer situation, assuming full subscription of the Capital Increase), the
shareholders and the Bondholders who decide not to subscribe to the Offer for the portion of their
entitlement could see their stake in the fully diluted capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around
27.59%.
Total net proceeds and estimate of total expenses linked to the Offer
The net proceeds deriving from the Capital Increase, if fully subscribed, net of expenses, are estimated to be
approximately Euro 975 million. Total expenses, inclusive of the guarantee commission, are estimated to
amount to a maximum of approximately Euro 25 million.
Reasons for the Offer and use of the proceeds
The purpose of the Capital Increase is to further strengthen the UBI Banca Group’s capital position, with the
aim of supporting growth and enabling the Group to grasp all the opportunities arising from future economic
growth.
Since its inception, the UBI Banca Group has always considered its capital strength to be one of the most
distinctive competitive factors in the national banking scene and has always positioned itself among the “best
in class” in terms of capital, taking into account the Group’s focus on the traditional deposit and lending
business and its low exposure to financial risks.
Specifically, the Capital Increase will allow the Group to strengthen its capital ratios, which as at 31
December 2010 came to 6.95%, in terms of Core Tier I Ratio, 7.47%, in terms of Tier I Ratio, and 11.17%, in
terms of Total Capital Ratio.
The increase in the capital ratios consequent to the Capital Increase will allow the Group to anticipate the
alignment with the more stringent capital requirements for banks which are in the process of being
introduced in view of the coming into effect of Basel III, and to achieve a further improvement in the mix
and the quality of the Group’s capital by a further reinforcement of common equity as required by the new
regulations which will be progressively implemented.
In addition, via the Capital Increase the Group will equip itself with the financial resources necessary to
support growth as envisaged in the Industrial Plan. In this sense, the availability of adequate financial
resources should allow the Group to accentuate its competitiveness on the reference market, improve its 
Summary Note
35
positioning and grasp endogenous growth opportunities which will present themselves over the coming
years, all the while pursuing a sustainable dividend distribution policy.
Also, in the Issuer’s opinion, the Capital Increase should permit the Group to improve and strengthen the
ratings assigned by the international agencies with possible potential benefits in terms of funding costs.
E. SUPPLEMENTARY INDICATIONS
Share capital and ratings
As at the Prospectus Date, the Issuer’s share capital, fully subscribed and paid-in, amounted to Euro
1,597,865,425, represented by 639,146,170 ordinary shares with a par value of Euro 2.50 each.
For further information, please see Section One, Chapter XXI.
The Issuer has been assigned ratings by the international agencies Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and
Moody’s.
All three rating agencies have submitted an application for registration to ESMA for the activities carried out
in Europe (in Italy via: Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services Italy S.r.l., Moody’s Italia S.r.l. and Fitch
Italia Società italiana per il rating S.p.A.) and are awaiting registration.
On 23 April 2010, as part of a general analysis of Italian banks, Standard & Poor’s confirmed the short and
long-term counterpart rating for UBI Banca, downgrading the outlook from Stable to Negative in relation to
a perceived lower capacity of the Group to absorb higher than expected credit losses in the event of a
faltering of the fragile economic recovery. On 6 May Standard & Poor’s confirmed the short-term
counterparty rating as A-1 and long-term counterparty rating as A, with a Negative outlook.
On 17 December 2010, Fitch Ratings reduced the long-term counterpart rating of UBI Banca from A+ to A,
with a Stable outlook, confirming all the other ratings. The action was taken in consideration of the
slowdown in economic activity in Italy and the persistent low level of market rates which, in the ratings
agency’s opinion, make a rapid recovery in UBI Banca’s operating profitability unlikely. At the same time,
Fitch confirmed: the importance of the Group’s franchise, located in the wealthiest regions of Italy; the sound
management and perception of credit risk, which has permitted loan quality to deteriorate to a lesser extent
than other competitors; the adequate capitalisation in relation to the conservative approach to risk; as well as
the adequate liquidity, with well diversified funding sources. As a consequence of the manoeuvre, the ratings
on the outstanding issues (Senior debt, Lower Tier 2 and hybrid securities) were reduced by a notch.
For further information, please see Section Two, Chapter X, Paragraph 10.5.

CHAPTER III – SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ISSUER
Introduction
In the following section there is a selection of financial information for the quarter ended 31 March 2011 and
for the financial years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Directive 2003/71/EC and Article 28 of Regulation (EC) 809/2004. The consolidated financial statements as
at and for the years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008 have been previously published and filed with
Consob. All the aforementioned documents are publicly available on the website of the Issuer
(www.ubibanca.it) and at the Headquarters of the Issuer and Borsa Italiana.
3.1 Main accounting data
The following table shows key reclassified financial data for the years ended as at 31 December 2010, 2009
and 2008.

Profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Parent 172,121 270,099 69,001 -36.27% 291.44%
Profit excluding non-recurring items 105,116 173,380 425,327 -39.37% -59.24%
Net profit for 2010 amounted to Euro 172.1 million, a decrease in comparison with Euro 270.1 million in
2009.
This result was strongly influenced by the macroeconomic scenario (in particular by the level of interest
rates), which is still characterised by uncertainty and disorientation of market operators.
The decrease in core revenues of the Group – that followed the financial markets crisis of the last quarter of
2008 – continued during 2010, as shown by the results for net interest income and net commission income.
This negative trend was only partially offset by a strict policy of cost containment and by a lower incidence
of impairment losses on loans.
The 2009 financial year showed a profit of Euro 270.1 million compared with Euro 69 million of the
previous twelve months.
For the sake of completeness and in order to facilitate analysis of the Group’s performance, information
provided refers to results net of the main non recurring items, which can be summarised as follows (net of
taxes and minority interests):

Profit excluding non-recurring items 64,609 38,125 69.47%
During the first quarter of 2011, thanks to the improvement in the result from financial operations, the effects
of the trade union agreement dated 20 May 2010 and the progressive downsizing of the net impairment
losses on loans, the Group generated net profit of Euro 64.6 million (+ 69.5% compared with Euro 38.1
million in the first three months of last year).
In particular, although net interest income was down from the first quarter of 2010, it reflects the initial
positive reactions to the reversal of trends in market rates. It should also be noted that as at 31 March 2011
this aggregate reflects the negative impact from the increase in the cost of institutional funding partly due to
several issues being brought forward to the beginning of the year.
Net operating income benefited in particular from the contribution of financial operations, which produced a
net profit of Euro 14.6 million as at 31 March 2011 compared to Euro 4.9 million as at 31 March 2010.
In terms of operating expenses, cost containment measures continued and were reflected in all item of the
aggregate (personnel expenses, other administrative expenses and net value adjustments on property,
equipment and investment property and intangible assets).
Net impairment losses on loans were also down with respect to the same period last year, reflecting the first
positive results achieved following the realignment of the credit quality of the Product Companies, in
particular B@nca 24-7 and UBI Leasing.
The following table shows key financial data reclassified for the years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and
2008 and for the quarter ended as at 31 March 2011.

Loans to customers as at 31 March 2011 totalled Euro 102.7 billion, up 0.87% with respect to the end of
2010.
During the first three months of 2011, growth in the loan portfolio (+ Euro 0.9 billion) was bolstered by
“Mortgage and medium/long-term loans” (+ Euro 0.7 billion; + 1.4%), repurchase agreements (+ Euro 0.2
billion, + 65.3%) and current accounts (+ Euro 0.5 billion, +3.5%) which more than offset the negative trend
of the non-banking financial services sector (- Euro 0.2 billion for leasing and factoring) and “other
transactions” (- Euro 0.3 billion).
Total Group funding at the end of March 2011 amounted to Euro 182.8 billion, with an increase of 2.4% on
an annual basis. In the comparison with the year end balances, all the main components were by contrast
down; in particular repurchase agreements with the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (Central
Counterparty Clearing) reported a reduction of Euro 1.1 billion reflecting lower investments in Italian
government securities, along with current accounts and term deposits which fell overall by around Euro 1
billion.
Securities issued totalled Euro 48.7 billion due to the gradual growth in bonds issued.
At the end of March 2011, indirect deposits from ordinary Group customers totalled Euro 78 billion, a
decrease on an annual basis, but largely unchanged from figures for the end of the previous year.
The Group’s net interbank balance was a negative Euro 2.8 billion, up slightly with respect to the end of the
year (+ Euro 0.5 billion), but down compared to the average quarterly figure for 2010.
Loans to Group customers as at 31 December 2010 totalled Euro 101.8 billion, up constantly with respect to
December 2009 (+ 3.9%) and December 2008 (+ 5.7%).
Direct funding – which as at 31 December 2010 amounted to Euro 106.8 billion – recorded an increase of
Euro 9.5 billion on an annual basis (Euro 5.8 billion in customer deposits and Euro 3.7 billion in securities
issued).
In detail, the component relating to customer deposits showed substantial stability in the entries related to
current accounts, term deposits and repurchase agreements with customers while the repurchase agreements
with the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (Central Counterparty Clearing) – which was used starting
from June 2010 to fund the position in government bonds as part of an exercise to strengthen the Group’s
profitability – register strong growth year on year (Euro 9.2 billion at end 2010 against Euro 3.5 billion at the
end of 2009).
The component relating to securities issued, benefited from an increase in institutional funding in both the
medium/long term as well as in the short-term.
Indirect deposits decreased slightly compared to December 2009, the growth of insurance and asset
management components (respectively +1.8% and +1.6% year on year) is worthy of note, while there was a
drop in the value of assets under custody (- 3.8% compared with 2009).
The net interbank exposure as at 31 December 2010 was broadly in line with 2009.
As at 31 December 2009 loans to customers of the Group amounted to Euro 98 billion, an increase of 1.7%
compared to December 2008.
Breaking down the aggregate of funding into its two components shows that the increase in issued securities,
during 2010, has only partially offset the decline in customer deposits which at the end of 2008 – when
customers were faced with general uncertainty in relation to the reference scenario – benefited from a
customer preference for a more liquid type of deposit.
Indirect deposits – increasing by 6.1% year on year – seemed to recover compared with the end of 2008,
showing an increase in all items of the aggregate.

The following table shows the earnings per share of the consolidated UBI Group for the years ended as at 31
December 2010, 2009 and 2008 and for the quarter ended as at 31 March 2011.
Earnings per share
(in Euro) 31/03/2011 31/12/2010 31/12/2009 31/12/2008
Basic EPS 0.1011 0.2633 0.4131 0.1075
Diluted EPS 0.1011 0.2633 0.4131 0.1075
For all the above periods reported the “diluted” earnings per share is very similar to the “basic”.
More in detail, as at 31 December 2009 there were potentially outstanding ordinary shares of UBI Bank due
to both subscription rights arising from the possession of Warrants as well as the possible conversion of
Convertible Bonds. However, Warrants are exercisable only starting from 1 June 2011, while the right to
convert the Convertible Bonds into ordinary shares was not possible before December 2010. As there was no
conversion during 2010, it is clear that for both 2009 and 2010 the value of the “basic” EPS and “diluted”
EPS substantially coincide. Finally, in the first quarter of 2011, 268 Convertible Bonds were converted into
UBI Shares.
As at 31 December 2008 there were no potentially outstanding ordinary shares of UBI Banca.

With reference to the items Deteriorated loans and Performing loans, both net of impairment losses, the
following is a comparison between the Group and the ABI Sample for the periods 2009 and 2010, which

The trend in gross deteriorated loans remains high on a tendential basis also as a result of the overall pick-up
during the first quarter of 2011.
As at 31 March 2011, gross deteriorated loans amounted to Euro 7.91 billion, up Euro 0.44 billion in the first
quarter. During the first three months of the year, the growth trend affected both non-performing loans
(+Euro 0.2 billion) and impaired loans (Euro 0.18 billion) to an almost equal extent, and other categories of
impaired loans to a residual extent.
The overall degree of coverage, albeit slightly down, was confirmed at adequate levels in relation to the
estimated loss on newly classified positions, due to the existence of collateral or because these are operative
impaired positions/restructured loans in relation to which agreements have been reached for the rescheduling
of debt following the subscription of a plan for the recovery of debt exposure pursuant to Article 67 or a debt
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182 bis of the Bankruptcy Law.
With regard to performing loans, the degree of coverage came to 0.53% with no major changes (0.54% both
in December and March 2010).
During 2010, gross deteriorated loans showed an increase with respect to the previous year which, during the
last quarter, had been affected by alignment with the new provisions of the Bank of Italy for the category of
past due loans.
At the end of December 2010, net deteriorated loans totalled Euro 5.26 billion, an increase on an annual
basis of Euro 0.73 billion (+16.1%). The evolution over the 12 months of the year regarded mainly nonperforming
loans (+ Euro 0.61 billion), compared with the more modest increase in impaired loans (+ Euro
0.19 billion) and restructured loans (+ Euro 0.39 billion) that was only partly offset by a reduction in past due
loans (- Euro 0.46 billion), within which even the portion of past due loans secured by real estate overdue by
more than 90 days diminished significantly (- Euro 0.27 billion).
The total coverage of deteriorated loans increased slightly compared to December 2009 (from 28.89% to
29.52%).
From a technical point of view, as at 31 December 2010, 56% of the annual growth of net deteriorated loans
regarded the line item “Mortgage loans and other medium/long-term loans”, characterised by the presence of
collateral that renders a lower level of coverage within the norm.
As at 31 December 2009, net deteriorated loans amounted to Euro 4.53 billion (+ 95.7% over the previous
year, an increase on an annual basis of Euro 2.22 billion).
This evolution affected all the main categories of deteriorated loans and was accompanied by a reduction in
overall coverage (28.89% against 35.80% a year earlier) due to lower estimated loss on the newly
reclassified positions (in particular positions that are past due, or guaranteed positions that are related to a
debt restructuring plan and impaired loans related to credit exposures for which debt rescheduling has been
requested). 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

Already in the 2009 financial year, about 70% of the annual increase in deteriorated loans was due to
“Mortgage Loans” and “Leasing”, types of loan that were most affected by the reclassification to deteriorated
assets of those positions past due by more than 90 days, backed by mortgages.

hybrid instruments have a limited incidence, i.e. as at the date of 31 March 2011, 6.8% compared with the maximum permitted by current
regulations of 35%.
As at 31 December 2010 the UBI Banca Group’s Total Capital exceeded Euro 10.5 billion, up from about
Euro 10.2 billion at the end of 2009.
The change during the financial year represents a parallel strengthening of Tier I and Tier II capital and a
reduction in the deductions applied to both components, the effects of which more than offset the increase in
negative filters.
At the end of 2010, compliance with the capital adequacy requirement led to a capital requirement of more
than Euro 7.5 billion, an increase of Euro 0.7 billion over the previous year due to the increased absorption at
the level of credit and counterparty risk compared with a modest decrease of absorption related to market
risks, mainly due to the cancellation of foreign exchange risk, and to diminished operational risk, as a result
of the decline in consolidated net operating income.
The result was a general decrease in all the capital ratios as at 31 December 2010, calculated by taking into
account the effects of the proposed dividend.
Core Tier I ratio dropped to 6.95%, Tier I ratio to 7.47% while the Total Capital ratio was 11,17%.

These indices do not include an additional potential positive effect of more than 70 basis points (estimated on
current data) which could come from the possible conversion of the convertible bond issued in July 2009.
There could be further benefits arising from the future adoption of the Advanced method for calculating
capital requirements in relation to credit and operational risk.
Following the capital increase of up to a maximum of Euro 1 billion – on the basis of a simulation exercise
on data as at 31 December 2010 – Core Tier I would be around 8.01%, Tier I 8.53% and Total Capital ratio
12.23% (the effect is +106 basis points).

CHAPTER IV – RISK FACTORS
The transaction described in the Prospectus presents the elements of risk characteristic of an investment in
listed shares.
In order to make a correct assessment of the investment, investors are requested to evaluate the specific risk
factors relating to the Company and companies in the Group, to the business sectors in which they operate
and to the financial instruments offered.
The risk factors described in this chapter, “Risk Factors”, must be read in conjunction with the information
contained in the Prospectus.
References to Sections, Chapters and Paragraphs refer to the Sections, Chapters and Paragraphs of the
Prospectus.
4.1 RISK FACTORS CONNECTED WITH THE BUSINESS OFTHE ISSUER AND THE GROUP
4.1.1 Risks connected with the impact of the market situation and macroeconomic context on the
performance of the UBI Banca Group
The performance of the UBI Banca Group is influenced by the financial market situation as well as the
macroeconomic context in the countries in which it operates. In particular, the global financial system has
been operating under difficult conditions since August 2007, and the performance of the financial markets
was particularly negative after a number of primary international financial institutions filed for bankruptcy,
which took place starting in September 2008. This situation has led to grave distortions in financial markets
throughout the world, with problems of unprecedented severity in obtaining liquidity, in particular at the
level of the international banking system. Overall, the Italian banking system has felt the effects of the crisis
situation to a lesser extent than those banking systems that reference other markets (both European and North
American), among other things thanks to a model of intermediation oriented primarily to the retail lending
and deposit business. This situation, however, has brought significant tensions to the normal course of
business of many front-line commercial banks, investment banks and global insurance companies, a number
of which are counterparties to the Group. In response to the market’s instability and lack of liquidity, a
number of States, including EU Member States and the United States, have intervened to inject liquidity and
capital into the system, with the objective of stabilising these financial markets and, in certain cases, of
preventing the insolvency of financial institutions.
The circumstances mentioned above have led to a slowdown in the Group’s business, an increase in the cost
of financing, a drop in share prices and asset values, and additional costs deriving from write-downs and
depreciation, resulting in a reduction in profitability (see Section One, Chapter XX of the Prospectus). In this
regard, the Group has not benefited from the above-mentioned stabilisation and liquidity injection
interventions.
Beginning in the second half of 2009, albeit with an uncertain global scenario and future outlook, the
macroeconomic picture and the financial system recorded signs of improvement, in part thanks to the support
provided by the stabilisation measures put in place by major countries and by the regulatory authorities. The
improving trend in the global economic scenario was also confirmed over the course of 2010, benefiting
from the effects of the expansive anti-crisis policies which countries implemented at the international level.
This development, however, was held in check by the sovereign debt crisis in those European States
characterised by unbalanced public finances (Greece, Spain and Portugal in particular) and by problems in
the banking systems of certain countries which proved to be particularly exposed to the international crisis
(such as Ireland and Iceland). Further uncertainties derive both from the natural and nuclear disaster affecting
Japan, the economic consequences of which are still difficult to estimate, as well as the geopolitical tensions
convulsing areas in North Africa and the Middle East. In this connection, the considerable appreciation in
raw materials prices recorded in the most recent quarters – particularly in the energy sector – is of note and,
mirroring that, the recent increase in inflationary pressures which constitute risk factors for the consolidation
of the recovery. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
RISK FACTORS
54
In the event that the aforesaid circumstances should worsen, the Group might sustain additional negative
consequences for its economic results and financial and capital position.
In addition, while having limited exposure to those financial institutions beset by serious financial difficulties
and affected by the acceptance of public capital, the Group is in any event exposed to the risk of loss when
financial institutions or other credit counterparties become insolvent or otherwise unable to meet their
obligations. The Group’s performance could also be affected by an inability to recover the value of its assets
to a degree consistent with its own historic recovery estimates, which may in fact turn out to be no longer
accurate in a market context characterised by unprecedented turbulence. In the present instance, the United
States and a number of European countries, Italy included, are currently in a phase of continuing moderate
economic recovery. But looking ahead, a number of elements are emerging that make it impossible to rule
out either a temporary pullback in the pace of growth or problems with the process of consolidating the
recovery. In this regard, it is noted that – notwithstanding recent improvements – the labour market is still
marked by a high level of unemployment. Also recall that, over the past year, Eurozone GDP has benefited to
a significant extent from the positive momentum of external demand. In this respect, the situation in Europe
could feel the effects of any moderating of the rate of growth in the world’s economy, among other things in
light of restrictive monetary measures taken in a number of emerging countries intended to counteract
inflationary spikes, of the aforementioned crisis in North Africa and the Middle East, and of the natural and
nuclear disaster in Japan. On the whole, the macroeconomic picture remains positive; yet the cited factors of
global uncertainty and a noticeable appreciation in the price of commodities could cause a slowdown in the
rhythm of growth. The risk factors mentioned have put downward pressure on share prices and the funding
costs of financial institutions, which have also had an effect on the Group.
Should the recovery not be consolidated, or if the crisis is further protracted or the economy performs poorly,
even due to the so-called “exit strategies” (including effective coordination of the latter by the relevant
authorities) which are to be implemented going forward to put an end to the stabilisation and liquidityboosting
measures, the Group might sustain additional negative consequences for its economic results and
financial and capital position.
Finally, as at the Prospectus Date, the UBI Banca Group is not exposed to government securities issued by
Portugal, Ireland, Greece or Spain, and is exposed to a negligible degree to Greek, Irish and North African
banks.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.2 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and for
the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.2 Risks connected with a failure to implement the 2011-2015 Industrial Plan
On 13 May 2011, to the extent of their respective authority, UBI Banca’s Management Board and
Supervisory Board approved the Group’s 2011-2015 Industrial Plan (the “Industrial Plan”), which contains
the strategic guidelines and the economic, capital and financial objectives described in the Prospectus (see
Section One, Chapter XIII).
The Industrial Plan is based on estimates and hypotheses relating to the achievement of future events
(including the full subscription of the Capital Increase) and action which will have to be undertaken by
management. The main hypotheses underlying the Industrial Plan include (i) assumptions of a general nature
relating to future events which essentially depend on exogenous variables which cannot be controlled by
Group management including the evolution of the macro-economic and financial scenario, as well as the
dynamics of the Italian lending system aggregates, (ii) assumptions of a discretional nature linked to specific
operational and organisation action which management will undertake during the timescale covered by the
Industrial Plan, as well as (iii) the effects expected by management as a consequence of the performance of
this operational and organisation action.
Due to the subjective nature of the assumptions contained in the Industrial Plan, if one or more of these
assumptions do not prove to be correct, or only a part of them do, or they turn out to be correct based on 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
55
conditions differing from those assumed (including as a result of events, which currently cannot be
anticipated or quantified, concerning the Group’s operations and the environment in which it operates), the
information, trends, and projections indicated in the Industrial Plan and Prospectus could differ from those
that actually take place with resulting negative effects on the Group’s operations and its economic results
and/or financial and capital position.
The Prospectus contains the Group’s projections drawn up on the basis of specific knowledge of the sector it
belongs to, the available figures and the management’s experience. These projections are based on
hypotheses concerning future events and trends subject to uncertainties which if they do not occur could lead
to changes with respect to the projections made that could also be significant.
Due to the uncertainty which characterises the projections, the investors should not rely exclusively on the
same when making their investment decisions.
The Independent Auditors report on the projections included in the Prospectus is attached to the same in
enclosure form.
(See Section One, Chapter XIII of the Prospectus).
4.1.3 Risks connected with the trend in UBI Banca Group’s operating results
This risk factor highlights the risks connected with investment in the capital of the Company in consideration
of the trend in the Group’s operating results over the last few financial years, as well as in consideration of
current market conditions.
Over the course of financial year 2010, the Group carried out operations of a non-recurring nature that had a
net positive impact on 2010 operating results.
In particular, the Group benefited from revenues deriving from the disposal of a number of non-strategic
assets. This took the form, first, of the sale of “custodian bank” operations (which generated net capital gains
of Euro 83.9 million) and, second, the transfer of a further 9.9% of the share capital of Lombarda Vita S.p.A.
to the Cattolica Assicurazione Group (which generated net capital gains of Euro 60.9 million). A further Euro
7.4 million in capital gains was generated by the disposal of other assets (see Section One, Chapter V,
Paragraph 5.1.5).
In addition to the operations just described, however, it is necessary to flag a number of extraordinary events,
classified as “non-recurring” components, that had a negative impact on the Group’s operating results in
2010. In particular, under the provisions of a trade union agreement dated May 20, 2010, the Group has
provided incentives for the departure of more than 500 staff members, taking a net charge of Euro 22.4
million (see Section One, Chapter XVII, Paragraph 17.1 of the Prospectus). Furthermore, impairment testing
on the interests in Intesa Sanpaolo and A2A, as well as on the TLcom fund, classified as “Available For
Sale”, occasioned a total net loss of Euro 40.5 million (see Section One, Chapter III, Paragraph 3.1 of the
Prospectus). Finally, note should be taken of the tax effect resulting from the so-called branch “switching” as
part of the Optimisation Project, leading to a further charge for the Group of Euro 15.3 million (see Section
One, Chapter V, Paragraph 5.2.1 of the Prospectus).
Net of the aforesaid non-recurring components, as at 31 December 2010 the Group recorded “normalised”
profits of Euro 105.1 million, represented by the net profit for the period net of the effects associated with the
aforesaid non-recurring components.
In a context of general uncertainty typical of periods of economic crisis such as that in progress as at the
Prospectus Date, it cannot be ruled out that the Group’s future earnings may be influenced by events of an
extraordinary nature, positive as well as negative.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and for
the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).

4.1.4 Risks connected with capital adequacy
In order to increase the capital of the UBI Banca Group and in a market context still marked by perceptible
elements of uncertainty, UBI Banca has issued a Convertible Bond, within a number of actions taken to
strengthen capital, giving the Group a flexible instrument for optimising its capital and financial structure,
taking into account the need to reinforce the consolidated capital ratios over time. The Issuer has the option
to convert the Convertible Bond into ordinary UBI Banca shares at its maturity date in 2013, or even in
advance, thereby increasing the Group’s core capital.
The purpose of the capital increase is to strengthen the Group’s capital and anticipate its adjustment to the
more stringent capital requirements being introduced in a market context still marked by perceptible
elements of uncertainty. In this context, the Convertible Bond (amounting to Euro 639,145,872) would
maintain its character of being a flexible instrument to be used in a not altogether favourable macroeconomic
scenario, or when faced with new and more rigid regulatory restrictions.
For the estimated effects of the capital increase on the Group’s capital ratios, see Section One, Chapter III of
the Prospectus.
Over the course of the first six months of 2010, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS),
conducted a stress test on a sample of 91 European banks representing 65% of the entire European banking
sector. The Issuer was among the five Italian banks included in the sample. The purpose of such test is to
assess the banking system’s capacity to absorb shocks of a macroeconomic nature from credit risks and
market risks, including those deriving from deterioration of the credit quality in European countries. The test,
conducted using the scenarios, methodologies and assumptions indicated by CEBS, under the aegis of the
Bank of Italy, showed that, even under an adverse scenario and taking account of sovereign risk, the Group’s
estimated Tier I ratio would be 6.8% by the close of 2011 (compared with 8% observed at the close of 2009),
therefore above the regulatory minimum of 4% and above the minimum threshold of 6%, indicated solely for
the purposes of such test as the minimum threshold for passing the stress test. However, the results of the
unfavourable scenario should not be considered representative of the current situation or indicative of
possible capital requirements. A stress test does not provide projections of the expected results, since the
unfavourable scenarios are outlined as “what if” scenarios which include plausible but extreme events that
therefore have a low probability of occurring.
Finally, as at the Prospectus Date, a new stress test is under way, the results of which (expected sometime in
June 2011) will be notified to the public through an appropriate press release by the deadlines and in the
manner agreed with the competent authorities.
(See Section One, Chapters III, V and XX of the Prospectus, and the Interim financial report as at and for the
period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI Banca’s
registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.5 Risks connected with the worsening of credit quality in the markets and business sectors in
which the Issuer operates
The UBI Banca Group is subject to credit risk, i.e., the risk that a debtor of the Group will not fulfil its
obligations or that its associated credit quality will decline. An evaluation of the possible losses the Group
might incur in relation to individual credit exposures and the overall loan portfolio depends on a multitude of
factors, including the trend in general economic conditions or those relating to specific sectors of production,
changes to the rating of individual counterparties, a weakened competitive position of counterparties,
possible poor management of the borrower companies or counterparties, household debt levels and other
external factors like legal and regulatory requirements. The Group is exposed to the normal risks relating to
lending activity, which are greater in periods of economic difficulty. Hence, the Group is exposed to a
deterioration in the quality of its own loan portfolio.
An ongoing crisis situation on the credit markets, deteriorating conditions on the capital markets, and a
slowdown in the global economy could have negative repercussions on the ability of bank customers to 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
57
honour commitments assumed, and could therefore cause a significant lowering of credit quality in the
sectors in which the Issuer does business. In particular, the effects deriving from the deterioration of credit
quality recorded over the course of 2010 in UBI Leasing’s real estate and machinery and equipment sector
(with regard to both the “agent” and the “bank” distribution channels) have been dealt with by internal
reorganisation, portfolio reclassification and a review of lending procedures. In the judgement of the Group’s
management, such actions will permit a greater focus on the development of “captive” customers as well as a
more careful selection of business via the agent channel.
Notwithstanding the fact that bank operators periodically set aside provisions for possible losses, including
based on the historic data available to them, an increase in provisions might become necessary as a
consequence of an increase in non-performing loans and a deterioration in economic conditions, which in
turn might entail an increase in instances of insolvency. In that respect, any significant increase in provisions
for non-performing loans, any change in estimates of credit risk, as well as any accrued loss that exceeds the
amount of provisions, could have a negative effect on the Group’s economic results and financial and capital
position.
A deterioration of credit quality exposes the Group to the risk of a possible increase in “Net impairment
losses on deteriorated loans” and a possible increase in the cost of credit, with a consequent reduction in the
profits distributable by the Issuer. Moreover, reduced profitability might lead to a reduced ability for the
Group to finance itself out of its own operations, with a possible resulting effect on its capital profile.
The following table shows data relating to the impact of net deteriorated loans and impairment losses on total
net loans to customers for the years ended as at 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008, and for the quarter ended
as at 31 March 2011.

(*) Annualised figure.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and for
the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.6 Risks connected with obtaining liquidity on the markets
As at 31 December 2010, the Group’s total liabilities (not including equity and Group profit) amounted to
Euro 118.6 billion (49% of which was represented by amounts due to customers, 41% by securities issued
and 5% by amounts due to banks) while as at 31 March 2011 total liabilities amounted to Euro 120.6 billion
(47% of which was represented by amounts due to customers, 40% by securities issued and 6% by amounts
due to banks).
The ability to obtain liquidity for carrying out its various activities is essential for the UBI Banca Group to
achieve its strategic objectives.
Furthermore, liquidity is essential for the Issuer to be able to meet foreseen or unforeseen payment
obligations, in cash or by delivery, in such a way as not to prejudice the Group’s current operations or
financial situation.
The current international context, marked by extreme volatility and extraordinary uncertainty on the financial
markets, has contributed towards fuelling a progressive unavailability of liquidity on the institutional market
and a simultaneous generalised climate of distrust towards obtaining funds from the interbank market.
The Group might be impaired in obtaining liquidity by the Issuer’s inability to access the debt market or to
sell its assets. Such circumstances could occur, inter alia, because of a worsening of market conditions,
distrust on the financial markets, uncertainty and speculation relating to the solvency of market participants, 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
RISK FACTORS
58
or ratings downgrades. A limited ability to obtain the necessary liquidity from the market on favourable
terms, or difficulty in accessing long-term financing on favourable terms, could have negative effects on the
Group’s economic results and financial and capital position.
A limited capacity to obtain such liquidity on the market on favourable terms could also negatively affect the
achievement of the Group’s objectives, even though the interbank channel is of a residual nature compared to
the other sources of funding of the Group. However diversified, funding from institutional markets
represents a contained share of total funding, complementing direct funding from customers.
The Group in fact continues to devote particular strategic attention to strengthening its funding from regular
customers, via funding policies intended to preserve the Group’s structural balance and which are capable of
generating fund flows sustainable over time and consistent with the growth of lending.
In order to strengthen its liquidity position, owing to the modest signs of improvement in the institutional
funding market, the Group resumed its funding programme over the course of the third quarter of 2010,
which it then intensified in the initial months of 2011.
In this context, preferred use was made of covered bonds, owing to their lower cost relative to senior EMTN
issues of the same duration.
Specifically, in the second half of 2010 UBI Banca made two significant international placements of covered
bonds, pursuant to Article 7 bis of Law 130/1999, with a AAA/Aaa Fitch/Moody’s rating: on 15 September, a
first issue of Euro 1 billion, maturing September 2017, and on 18 October, a second issue for Euro 500
million, maturing October 2015.
In addition, at the end of April a private placement was made for Euro 250 million with the European
Investment Bank, under an agreement entered into with the EIB for the financing of Italian small and
medium-sized companies.
In 2011, UBI Banca appeared on the covered bond market with two other important international
placements: a first issue in January for Euro 1 billion with a ten-year maturity (28 January 2021), and a
second in February, for Euro 750 million with a five-year maturity (22 February, 2016).
All of the transactions described above took place under the programme for a maximum of Euro 10 billion in
existence since July 2008 – the “multioriginator” programme providing for regular participation by ten banks
in the Group – and will be added to the two preceding issues for Euro 1 billion each that were made in the
second half of 2009.
Overall, therefore, as at the Prospectus Date UBI Banca has covered bonds outstanding for a total nominal
amount of Euro 5.5 billion, out of a maximum of Euro 10 billion.
For the reasons set out, there has been limited resort to the EMTN programme: after the public placement of
a nominal amount of Euro 700 million with a three-year term (March 2013) which took place in March 2010,
UBI Banca returned to the market only at the end of October, with a senior bond in the amount of Euro 1
billion, maturing in two years (5 November, 2012). These two issues substantially offset the securities
expired/repaid over the course of the year (6 bonds, including 2 subordinated, in a total nominal amount of
Euro 1.7 billion).
Funds continued to be obtained on the EMTN market even in the first few months of 2011: a January private
placement of Euro 80 million maturing in two years was followed in February by a public placement of a
two-year senior bond of an amount equal to Euro 700 million, in March by a private placement of 3-year
senior bonds in an amount equal to Euro 8 million and, in April, by a 2 year and 6 months senior bond in an
amount of Euro 1 billion.
In parallel, the Group intensified its short-term institutional funding under French CD and Euro Commercial
Paper programmes. As at 31 March 2011 there were French certificates of deposit amounting to a total of
Euro 2.181 billion, or 2.1% of total funding, and Euro Commercial Paper amounting to a total of Euro 0.793
billion, or 0.8% of total funding 
Section One
RISK FACTORS

Both cases involve instruments listed in Luxembourg issued by UBI Banca International, generally with
three-month maturities, which can offer a significant buffer for optimisation of liquidity and funding
management. When the Luxembourg branch of Banco di Brescia (the original issuer) was transferred to UBI
Banca International, the two programmes were renewed by the acquiring institution with a parallel increase
in maximum amounts to cope with increasing business volumes.
(See Section One, Chapter V and Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.6.2 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial
report as at and for the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca
Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and
available at UBI Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.7 Risks connected with impairment of intangible assets
As at 31 March 2011, the UBI Banca Group’s intangible assets amounted to approximately Euro 5.5 billion
(an amount largely unchanged with respect to 31 December 2010), in particular referring to goodwill and
other intangibles deriving from the purchase price allocation made on April 1, 2007. In particular, intangible
assets with an indefinite life (as, for example, goodwill in the case of the Group) were subjected to
impairment testing focused on at least an annual verification of the adequacy of book value, and were not
amortised. Upon each annual or interim account closing, where there is evidence of impairment, an estimate
is made of the asset’s recoverable value. The amount of the loss, recognised in income, is equal to the
difference between the asset’s book value and its recoverable value. As at 31 December 2010 the goodwill
impairment losses — amounting to Euro 5,172 thousand (zero as at 31 March 2011) referred to the Barberini
S.A. and Gestioni Lombarda Suisse S.A. write-downs, Euro 1,027 thousand and Euro 4,145 thousand
respectively. Again as at the same date, the impairment losses for intangible assets were Euro 130,500
thousand (Euro 30,837 thousand as at 31 March 2011), of which Euro 4,502 thousand referred to the IT
systems write-off. By contrast, assets with a defined useful life (such as trademarks, core deposits, assets
under management, assets under custody and software) are periodically amortised and recorded at cost, net
of total amortisation and any impairments which have taken place. As at 31 March 2011, the impact of
intangible assets on the Group’s total equity, including the profit for the period, was approximately 49%
(approximately 50% as at 31 December 2010); in particular, the impact of goodwill was approximately 40%
(largely unchanged with respect to 31 December 2010). The impairment testing done as at 31 December
2010 confirmed the adequacy of the values recorded for goodwill: as at 31 March 2011, no situations have
been recognised that are indicative of reductions in the book values of fixed assets.
In particular, the value used to determine the recoverable value of the business units to which the goodwill
was assigned is equal to the value in use (or the fair value, in the event that the value in use is less than the
carrying amount). For all business units of the Group, as at 31 December 2010 the recoverable value
coincided with the value in use, except for the goodwill allocated to the business unit of Banco di Brescia.
With regard to goodwill, a sensitivity analysis was also performed in order to identify the maximum tolerable
increase in the key variables identified (in the specific cost of capital and cost of risk) whereby the
recoverable value is equal to the carrying amount of the business units shown on the consolidated financial
statements.
Finally, it is noted that the parameters and information used to verify the recoverability of goodwill that have
an impact on the profitability of the entities subject to impairment testing are significantly influenced by the
macroeconomic and market framework, which could undergo rapid changes in the future as it has in the
recent periods.

4.1.8 Risks connected with exposure to, and performance of, the real estate sector
The UBI Banca Group is exposed to the real-estate segment, inter alia, through financing provided to
companies operating in that sector, the cash flows of which are primarily generated by the sale or leasing of
commercial real estate. In recent years, the real estate market has posted a decline in market prices and in
transactions carried out; consequently, parties active in the sector have experienced a reduction in volumes
and operating margins, an increase in commitments deriving from financial charges, and greater difficulty in
refinancing. Increased unemployment in Italy and areas where the Group has exposures, reduced corporate
profits and an increase in corporate and personal insolvencies, may – with regard to lease payments –
decrease borrowers’ ability to repay debts taken on and reduce the value of the collateral which underlies the
financing that was obtained.
In addition, the unfavourable price trend on real estate markets could have a negative impact on the Issuer.
This would be the direct consequence of the effects of this trend on borrowers operating in the sector, and an
indirect result of the lower value of real estate collateral provided to obtain financing.
As at 31 December 2010, exposure to commercial real estate lending equalled around Euro 10 billion and
represented about 9.8% of total gross loans to the Group’s customers. As at the Prospectus Date, the Group
manages the risk of counterparty breach, including via an appropriate policy to defend against and mitigate
the risk of reduction in the value of real property furnished as collateral, a policy which defines processes
aimed at controlling the general and specific requirements for obtaining collateral and verifying that it is in
line with regulatory requirements. That notwithstanding, it cannot be ruled out that a decrease in the value of
real property and collateral (or a deterioration in other loan monitoring parameters) may in a number of
specific cases, cause a negative impact on counterparties’ earnings capacity. In particular, the problems and
difficulties to which counterparties operating under unfavourable market conditions are subject could have a
negative impact on the Group’s ability to obtain repayment of the amounts financed. The occurrence of the
above-described circumstances could have a negative effect on the Group’s economic results and financial
and capital position.

statements for the UBI Banca Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the
Prospectus by reference and available to the public at UBI Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet
at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.9 Risks connected with forward-looking statements and statements of key information
The Prospectus contains forward-looking statements regarding the future development of the market in
which UBI Banca Group operates. Such statements are based on hypothetical external scenarios and
assumptions that may be controlled in whole or in part.
The Prospectus also contains a number of statements of key information with regard to the business of the
Group and its position in the reference market. It is impossible to guarantee that such statements will be
borne out also in the future.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.2 and Chapter XIII of the Prospectus).
4.1.10 Risks connected with court proceedings in progress and investigations
As at the Prospectus Date, UBI Banca and the companies in the UBI Banca Group are involved in court
proceedings and in bankruptcy clawback actions, for which the Issuer formed provisions on the Interim
financial report as at and for the period ended 31 March 2011, in an amount believed appropriate to cover the
risks deriving from such disputes, based on an internal evaluation of the potential risk deriving from such
proceedings.
As at 31 December 2010, the provision for liabilities and charges relating to legal disputes came to Euro
113.9 million (Euro 108.7 million as at 31 March 2011). However, it is not impossible that proceedings not
included in the provision for liabilities and charges may in the future give rise to contingent liabilities, or that 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
61
the provisions set aside for liabilities and charges relating to legal disputes may be insufficient to cover the
liabilities deriving from a worse than expected negative outcome of the proceedings, with the consequent
possibility of negative effects on the Group’s economic results and financial and capital position.
In February of 2010, the Bank of Italy commenced investigations pursuant to Articles 54 and 68 of the
Consolidated Banking Act (TUB) – seeking to evaluate the Group’s profile with regard to the governance,
management and control of credit risk in the corporate customer segment. Subsequently, by a communication
dated 23 September, 2010, the regulatory authority gave orders for further inspections pursuant to TUB
Article 68. These inspections were concluded in the month of December 2010 and concerned governance,
management and the control of liquidity and interest rate risks. On the outcome of these enquiries the
Supervisory Board determined that there were certain weaknesses in the systems in place for the
management and control of the financial structure and liquidity and rate risks. UBI Banca promptly
illustrated to the Supervisory Board the interventions already under way and those that the Group intends to
make with the maximum priority with a view to eliminating the weaknesses found. Finally, on 28 January
2011, the Bank of Italy gave notice of the commencement of new investigations of the Group – once again
pursuant to TUB Article 68 – dealing with the governance and valuation of risks taken on by companies
which make use of significant agent networks (UBI Banca Private Investment and B@nca 24-7) or operate
online (IW Bank).
(See Section One, Chapter XX, Paragraph 20.7 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and
for the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and
for the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.11 Risks connected with tax dispute
In financial year 2010 and the three years preceding, tax authorities undertook a number of tax audits of UBI
Banca and a number of companies in the UBI Banca Group. These inspections related primarily to the
“reclassification for tax purposes of certain extraordinary transactions, the adjustment, on various grounds
primarily due to IAS/IFRS standards, of reported taxable income, and the modalities of applying tax rules
dealing with income credited to non-resident parties”. Following these audits, the Issuer and companies in
the Group were sent various tax assessment reports, partly confirmed by assessment notices.
The assessment notices thus far received amount in total to Euro 161.83 million (additional tax and related
penalties), while the additional taxes that can be inferred from the tax assessment reports received can be
estimated at about Euro 33.38 million, for a maximum potential risk totalling Euro 195.21 million (this
estimate does not include any claimed interest).
The potential liabilities that are classified as being probable amount, in total, to approximately Euro 13.6
million, justifying the formation of appropriate provisions. The remainder of the disputes have been
classified, including on the basis of external opinions, as a possible risk and thus, as provided by the
reference accounting standard, no provisions have been formed for them, although information is provided
with regard to them in the financial statements.
As at the Prospectus Date, the aforesaid audits and assessment activities have not yielded anything that might
modify the classification and evaluation of the potential liabilities previously discussed. In view of the tax
assessment reports, however, it cannot be excluded that, if said reports are confirmed in whole or in part by
assessment notices, they may give rise to additional charges for the Group, with the consequent possibility of
negative effects on the Group’s economic results and financial and capital position.

4.1.12 Risks connected with ratings
The risk associated with an issuer’s capacity to meet its obligations arising from the issuance of debt and
money-market instruments is defined by reference to the credit ratings assigned by independent ratings
agencies.
These evaluations and the related research may be of assistance to investors in analysing the credit risks
associated with financial instruments, since they provide indications regarding issuers’ capacity to meet their
obligations. The lower on the respective scale the rating assigned, the higher the risk assessed by the ratings
agency that the obligations will not be met or will not be met in full and/or in a timely manner. A rating,
however, does not represent a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any debt instrument issued, and may be
suspended, lowered or withdrawn at any time by the ratings agency which assigned it. A suspension,
lowering or withdrawal of an assigned rating may negatively influence the market price of the debt
instruments issued.
Also dependent on its credit rating is UBI Banca’s access to the market for obtaining financing not backed by
guarantees. Any lowering of its ratings could have an unfavourable impact on the Issuer’s and the UBI Banca
Group’s opportunities for accessing various liquidity instruments as well as on the latter’s ability to compete
on the market, which in turn could cause an increase in funding costs or require that additional collateral
guarantees be provided.
The following table summarises the ratings assigned to the Group by international agencies Standard &
Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s.

(*) Ratings for long-term debt refer to senior indebtedness.
(1) Capacity for repaying debt with a duration of under 1 year (A-1: best rating – D: worst rating).
(2) With reference to debts lasting longer than a year, this indicates the capacity for payment of interest and principal, along with any sensitivity to
the unfavourable effects of changed circumstances or a change in economic conditions (AAA: best rating – D: worst rating).
(3) Capacity for repaying short-term debt in local currency (maturity of less than 1 year). (Prime -1: highest quality – Not Prime: speculative grade).
(4) Capacity for repaying long-term debt in local currency (maturity equal to or greater than 1 year). Using the JDA (Joint Default Analysis)
methodology, this rating adds to the Bank Financial Strength Rating an evaluation of the probabilities of an intervention, when necessary, by
outside support (shareholders, the group to which the entity belongs, or official institutions) (Aaa: first quality – Baa3 medium quality).
(5) Bank Financial Strength Rating: This rating does not refer to the capacity for repaying the debt, but takes the bank’s intrinsic financial strength
into account (by analysing factors like geographic organisation, diversification of activities, financial fundamentals), in the absence of outside
support (A: best rating – E: worst rating).
(6) Capacity for repaying short-term debt (less than 13 months’ duration) (F1: best rating – D: worst rating).
(7) Capacity for meeting long-term financial commitments on time, regardless of the maturity of individual obligations. This rating is an indicator of
the probability of the issuer’s default (AAA: best rating – D: worst rating).
(8) Bank Individual Rating: Evaluation of the bank’s intrinsic strength (profitability, soundness of balance sheet, commercial network, management
capacity, operating context and outlook), viewed on the assumption that the bank cannot rely on outside forms of support (possible intervention
by a lender of last resort, support from shareholders, etc.) (A: best rating – E: worst rating).
(9) Judgement of the eventual probability, adequacy and timeliness of outside intervention (on the part of the State or reference institutional
shareholders) in the event the bank should find itself in difficulty (1: best rating – 5: worst rating).
In particular, on 23 April 2010, as part of a general analysis of Italian banks, Standard & Poor’s confirmed
the short and long-term counterpart rating for UBI Banca, downgrading the outlook from Stable to Negative
in relation to a perceived lower capacity of the Group to absorb higher than expected credit losses in the
event of a faltering of the fragile economic recovery. On 6 May Standard & Poor’s confirmed the short-term
counterparty rating as A-1 and long-term counterparty rating as A, with a Negative outlook. 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
63
On 17 December 2010, Fitch Ratings reduced the long-term counterpart rating of UBI Banca from A+ to A,
with a Stable outlook, confirming all the other ratings. The action was taken in consideration of the
slowdown in economic activity in Italy and the persistent low level of market rates which, in the ratings
agency’s opinion, make a rapid recovery in UBI Banca’s operating profitability unlikely. At the same time,
Fitch confirmed: the importance of the Group’s franchise, located in the wealthiest regions of Italy; the sound
management and perception of credit risk, which has permitted loan quality to deteriorate to a lesser extent
than other competitors; the adequate capitalisation in relation to the conservative approach to risk; as well as
the adequate liquidity, with well diversified funding sources. As a consequence of the manoeuvre, the ratings
on the outstanding issues (Senior debt, Lower Tier 2 and hybrid securities) were reduced by a notch.
In this regard, the rating’s historical performance has therefore not had any significant impact on the Group’s
funding cost.
The credit ratings assigned to UBI Banca constitute an evaluation by relevant ratings agencies of the capacity
of UBI Banca to meet its financial commitments, including those relating to debt securities. In determining
the rating assigned to the Issuer, the agencies examine and consider various indicators of the Group’s
performance, including profitability and the ability to keep its consolidated capital ratios within specified
levels. Should the Issuer fail to achieve or maintain the results measured by one or more indicators, or in the
event that the Group should not succeed in keeping its capital ratios at the predetermined level, this could
bring about a downgrade to the rating assigned by the agencies, with a consequently greater expense in
obtaining financing, greater difficulty in accessing the capital market, and a possible need to add to the
guarantees provided.
A lowering of the credit ratings of UBI Banca and related subsidiaries could also have negative repercussions
for the Group’s liquidity and could limit the Group’s capacity to conduct certain activities, including
strategically productive activities, with a resulting negative impact on the latter’s economic results and
financial and capital position.
(See Section Two, Chapter X, Paragraph 10.5 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and for
the period ended 31 March 2011 and consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.13 Risks deriving from the performance of existing joint ventures
The UBI Banca Group operates in the bancassurance (life and non-life business) and asset management
sector through specific joint venture agreements with front-rank companies. In particular, as regard the
bancassurance – non-life – sector, the Group holds a 49.99% share in UBI Assicurazioni (a joint venture with
BNP Paribas and Fortis), while for the life business, the Group holds a 49.99% share of Aviva Assicurazioni
Vita S.p.A. (a joint venture with the Aviva Group), a 50% share of Aviva Vita S.p.A. (a joint venture with the
Aviva Group) and, finally, a 40% share of Lombarda Vita S.p.A. (a joint venture with the Cattolica
Assicurazioni Group). During the course of the 2010 financial year: i) both the partnership agreements with
the Aviva Group, for distribution of life insurance products through bank branches of the Group, were
renewed until 31 December 2015; and ii) the partnership agreement with the Cattolica Assicurazioni Group,
for exclusive distribution of life insurance products at branches of Network Banks of the former Banca
Lombarda Group (Banco di Brescia, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca di Valle Camonica, Banco di San
Giorgio), was renewed until 31 December 2020. In the asset management sector, the Group carries out its
activities through its UBI Pramerica subsidiary, a joint venture with Prudential USA (65% UBI Banca – 35%
Prudential USA), the subject of a shareholders’ agreement signed by UBI Banca and Prudential International
on 18 January 2008 (subsequently modified on 1 July 2010 and 1 May 2011).
In this connection, it cannot be ruled out that possible situations of conflict between the participants in said
joint ventures, albeit specifically covered by such joint venture agreements, may in the future bring about,
inter alia, a restructuring of their corporate and operating structures, with possible prejudicial effects on the
Group’s economic results and/or financial and capital position, in particular on the results of the
bancassurance sector.

4.1.14 Market risk
The UBI Banca Group is exposed to the risk that the value of a financial asset or liability will diminish as a
result of the performance of market factors, such as share prices, interest rates, exchange rates and the
volatility thereof (generic risk).
Possible negative developments in the economic situation and markets of peripheral European countries may
have negative repercussions for the Group’s economic results and financial and capital position.
4.1.14.1 Risks connected with interest rate fluctuation
The performance of the UBI Banca Group is influenced by the performance of and fluctuations in interest
rates in Europe and the other markets in which the Group carries out its activities. In particular, the results of
banking and financing operations depend on managing the sensitivity of the Group’s exposure to interest
rates, i.e., of the ratio between changes in reference-market interest rates and changes in the Net interest
income. Any misalignment between the interest income accrued by the Group and the interest expense owed
by it (in the absence of suitable instruments to protect against such misalignment) could have significant
effects on the Group’s economic results and financial and capital position.
(See Section One, Chapter V and Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.6.2 of the Prospectus and the consolidated
financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated
into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at
www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.14.2 Risks connected with exchange rates
In the UBI Banca Group, exchange rate risks relate to exposures of the banking portfolio originated by the
Network Banks and Product Companies – deriving from commercial activities of the same – and positions
relating to foreign currency trading activities.
Trading in foreign currency markets is carried out by the Group’s treasury, which operates through
instruments like forward currency transactions, Forex swaps, domestic currency swaps and currency options,
to optimise the risk profile deriving from the Group’s foreign currency positions.
Currency risk deriving from the banking portfolio’s exposures is mitigated by the systematic matching of the
latter, using funding/investment transactions in the same currency as that of the original transaction. Such
risk containment activity is also carried out by the Product Companies with regard to their “banking book”
positions. All of the remaining exposures and the trading portfolio are specifically covered by spot Forex
positions.
Any negative change in foreign currency rates would have very limited effects on the Group’s economic
results and financial and capital position.

4.1.14.3 Risks connected with the performance of financial markets
The performance of the financial markets has influenced the financial results of the UBI Banca Group with
reference to the following activities: (i) placement of assets under management and assets under custody
products, with consequent negative effects on placement commissions collected; (ii) management fees, via
lower asset values (direct effect) and redemptions possibly induced by unsatisfactory performance (indirect
effect); (iii) the results of the banking and trading portfolio. In particular, the Group is exposed to variations

amounted respectively to Euro 2.7 billion and Euro 147.3 million. As at 31 March 2011, these items
amounted to Euro 1.6 billion and Euro 474 million, respectively.
Finally, financial market volatility brings about a risk associated with operations in the wealth management,
brokerage and other sectors in which the Group is active where its activities are remunerated by commission.

Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.15 Operating risk
Operating risk is the risk of sustaining losses deriving from the inadequacy or incorrect functioning of
company procedures, from errors or deficiencies by human resources and internal systems, or from
exogenous events. Operating risk also includes legal risk but not strategic and reputational risk. It also
includes compliance risk, defined as the risk of incurring judicial or administrative sanctions or significant
financial losses as a consequence of mandatory rules or rules of self-governance. Among the principal
sources of operating risk are: instability of operating processes, errors, systems unavailability, IT security,
outsourcing of company functions, concentration of operations on a reduced number of suppliers, fraud,
errors, recruitment, training and retention of personnel and, finally, social and environmental impacts and
compliance with mandatory rules and rules of self-governance.
The Group has systems for reporting, evaluation and monitoring, as well as procedures for mitigation and
containment of operating risk, directed towards the prevention and limitation of the possible negative effects
deriving therefrom.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Group has employed resources, and continues to employ, them, to mitigate
operating risks, such risks could materialise in the future, including by reason of unforeseeable events,
including those outside the control of the Group. In view of the highly pervasive and widely varying nature
of operating risks and their endogenous and exogenous character, the possible occurrence of one or more of
such risks could have prejudicial effects on the Group’s financial and capital position and on its economic
results. Up to the Prospectus Date, the Group has not recorded any significant negative events connected
with operating risk.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.6.3 of the Prospectus and the Interim financial report as at and

for the year ended 31 December 2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI
Banca’s registered office as well as on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.16 Risks connected with the hedge fund portfolio
In April 2009, in view of the continuing period of uncertainty on the markets and the difficulties in the sector,
the Issuer decided to liquidate its entire hedge fund portfolio, excluding investments in funds managed by
UBI Pramerica, the NAV of which as at 31 December 2010 was equal to Euro 148.9 million (as at 31
December 2009, the NAV was equal to Euro 182.4 million). The NAV corresponding to funds managed by
UBI Pramerica (formerly Capitalgest) as at 31 March 2011 totalled Euro 144.8 million.
Over the course of the period ended on 31 December 2010 and during the first three months of 2011,
redemptions were received in the amount of approximately Euro 43 million and Euro 1.5 million,
respectively. At the end of December 2010, the redemption requests not yet repaid related to the remainder of
the hedge fund portfolio other than the UBI Pramerica funds. From management indications, it appears that
10 funds, in an amount of approximately Euro 22 million, are awaiting collection and/or have stated that they
are implementing a redemption plan deferred over time (a so-called “gate”) – as provided for by their
respective regulations; another 19 funds, in the amount of Euro 11 million, have instituted “side pockets”.

Banca continues to monitor the class actions commenced in the United States and the liquidation procedures
under way in the British Virgin Islands against the three other funds traceable to Madoff and, specifically,
Fairfield Sigma Ltd, Kingate Euro Ltd and Kingate Global Ltd., in order to safeguard the amounts owing to
UBI Banca in connection with such actions as well.
Finally, with reference to the Dynamic Decisions Growth Premium 2X fund, in liquidation, following the
signing of an agreement with the liquidators which, in exchange for financing provided to such liquidators,

4.1.17 Risk Management
The Group has an organisational structure, corporate processes, human resources and expertise for
identifying, monitoring, controlling and managing the various risks characteristic of its activities, such as
credit risk, market risk and operating risk.
The Group has instituted an internal risk committee dedicated to credit risks, operating risks and financial
risks to periodically monitor the levels of risk assumed, in order to safeguard against the aforesaid risks more
efficiently by establishing specific procedures to their control. However, if the policies and procedures of
companies in the Group geared toward the identification, monitoring and management of such risks should
prove not to be always adequate, the Group could suffer possible prejudicial effects on its economic results
and financial and capital position.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.6 of the Prospectus).
4.1.18 Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk represents the risk that the counterparty to a transaction in specific financial instruments
(such as, for example, transactions in OTC financial and credit derivatives, securities financing transactions
and transactions with a long-term settlement) should be in breach of its obligations prior to settlement of
such transaction.
The UBI Banca Group holds derivatives for purposes of hedging and trading, and deals in derivative
contracts for a wide variety of underlyings (interest rates, foreign currency, commodities, etc.), both with
institutional and non-institutional counterparties.
With reference to the Group’s derivatives trading, the negative fair value for the Group of derivatives for
trading purposes as at 31 December 2010 and 31 March 2011 amounted to Euro 545.2 million and Euro
449.5 million, respectively. As at the same dates, the positive fair value for the Group of derivatives for
trading purposes amounted to Euro 514.1 million and Euro 439.4 million, respectively. It is also noted that,
as at those dates, the derivatives exposure to local government entities is negligible in amount.
Other than to market risks and operating risks, such transactions also expose the Group to the risk that a
counterparty to derivative contracts will breach its obligations or become insolvent prior to the expiration of
the contract in question while the Issuer or a company in the Group still has an amount owing from such
counterparty. Such risk could turn out to be detrimental if any collateral held by UBI Banca or a company in
the Group should not be disposed of or liquidated at a value sufficient to cover the exposure relating to the
counterparty involved. 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
67
The counterparty risks associated with trading in derivatives are monitored by the Group through the
definition of guidelines and policies for the management, measurement and control of risks. In this regard,
however, it cannot be ruled out that, notwithstanding the adoption of such precautions and protections to
safeguard against the risks of a financial, credit and legal nature associated with the Group’s transactions in
financial derivatives, the concomitant breach by more than one counterparty of obligations assumed by it
towards the Issuer or a company in the Group in connection with such transactions, or a disposal or
liquidation of the associated collateral, where any exists, at insufficient amounts, may have prejudicial
effects on the Group’s economic results and financial and capital position and, consequently, on its
operations.

As at 31 December 2010, the UBI Banca Group had a network of 1,892 branches spread out across Italy;
66% of such branches, 71.65% of the deposits and 83.39% of the loans of the Group referred to regions of
northern Italy (in particular north-western Italy).
Such geographic concentration of its business exposes the Group to risks tied to the social, economic and
political conditions of the aforesaid regions, with possible negative effects on the Group’s economic results
and financial and capital position.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1 and Chapter VII of the Prospectus).
4.1.20 Risks of reduced ROE
The Capital Increase could entail a risk of reduction in the UBI Banca Group’s return on equity (ROE) in the
periods subsequent to its implementation. As at 31 December 2010, the Group’s ROE, determined as the
ratio between net profit and equity, excluding net profit for the period, was equal to 1.6%. The Capital
Increase will bring with it an increase in equity possibly without a corresponding proportional increase in net
profit, with a consequent reduction in the ROE subsequent to 31 December 2010.
(See the consolidated financial statements of the UBI Banca Group as at and for the year ended 31 December
2010, incorporated into the Prospectus by reference and available at UBI Banca’s registered office as well as
on the Internet at www.ubibanca.it).
4.1.21 Risks connected with limitation of share ownership and the exercise of voting rights
Article 30 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB) provides that no one may hold shares of a cooperative
bank (banca popolare) in an amount exceeding 0.50% of the share capital, except for undertakings for
collective investment in transferable securities, which are subject to the limits set by their specific
regulations. UBI Banca, once it becomes aware that such threshold has been exceeded and in any event
within the deadlines provided for by the regulations in force, must notify the owner of the shareholding and
the intermediary that the prohibition has been breached. The shares exceeding the indicated threshold must
be disposed of within one year of notification, subject to loss of the accrued economic rights, which will be
acquired by UBI Banca.
Article 30 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB) further provides that Shareholders of cooperative banks
shall have only one vote regardless of the number of shares held. Article 26 of the Corporate By-laws further
provides that each Shareholder may hold a proxy to represent not more than three Shareholders at
Shareholder meetings, and that a proxy for purposes of representation at Shareholder meetings may not be
given to members of the administrative or control bodies, employees of the Company or companies
controlled by it, or to members of the administrative or control bodies or employees of such companies, or to

(See Section One, Chapter XXI, Paragraph 21.2.5 of the Prospectus).
4.1.22 Risks associated with utilisation of unaudited financial information
The Prospectus contains financial information of the Group extracted from the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as at and for the years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008 and from the Interim
financial report as at and for the period ended 31 March 2011. The consolidated annual financial statements
as at and for the years ended 31 December 2010, 2009 and 2008 were audited by the Independent auditors
and the Interim financial report as at and for the period ended 31 March 2011 was subjected to a limited audit
by the Independent auditors. The Interim financial report as at and for the period ended 31 March 2011
presents, solely for comparative purposes, data relating to the corresponding period in the preceding year,
which were not reviewed by the Independent auditors.
4.2 RISK FACTORS CONNECTED WITH THE SECTOR IN WHICH THE ISSUER AND THE
GROUPOPERATE
4.2.1 Risks connected with competition
UBI Banca and companies in the UBI Banca Group are subject to typical risks deriving from the competition
proper to their respective areas of activity, and they face typical risks deriving from the exercise of banking
business in Italy. The Group is active in the major segments of lending and financial intermediation. In that
regard, it should be noted that the banking sector in Italy is undergoing a consolidation phase marked by a
heightened degree of competition, owing to the following factors: the transposition of Community directives
directed towards liberalisation of the banking sector in the European Union; deregulation of the banking
sector throughout the European Union which, particularly in Italy, has provided incentives for competition in
the traditional banking area, with the effect of progressively reducing the differential between active and
passive rates; the Italian banking industry’s tendency to focus on commission income, which leads to greater
competition in the field of asset management and investment banking services; the amendment of a number
of Italian tax and banking laws; the introduction of services with a strong component of technological
innovation, such as internet banking and phone banking. In addition, foreign banking institutions present in
Italy are expanding their activities, above all in the area of corporate banking.
The markets in which the Group operates are characterised by a growing competitiveness which, in the
absence of opportune corrective actions, may tend to reduce the Group’s profitability margins. The abovedescribed
processes may have a negative effect on the economic results and financial and capital position of
the Group, following increased competition in the reference sector.
(See Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.2 of the Prospectus).
4.2.2 Risks connected with the regulatory changes in the banking and financial sector
The UBI Banca Group is subject to an articulated set of regulation and, in particular, to supervision by the
Bank of Italy, Consob, and ISVAP with regard to bancassurance activities. The regulations applicable to the
Group govern the sectors in which banks may operate, for the purpose of preserving banks’ soundness and
stability by limiting their exposure to risk.
In particular, the Issuer and the banking companies of the Group must comply with the capital adequacy
requirements provided for by applicable banking regulations. Any variation in the manner in which said
regulations are applied, or in the implementation of regulations regarding capital requirements for financial
institutions – including the capital adequacy requirements – could affect the Group’s operations, financial
and capital position, cash flow and economic results. Since certain laws and regulations which also affect the
Group have only recently been approved, the related manner of application to the operations of financial
institutions is still evolving. 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
69
To determine weightings within the standard method (Basel II), Bank of Italy allows the use of credit
assessments (ratings) issued by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs). UBI Banca employs
assessments by certain ECAI, including the ratings provided by the Cerved Group (formerly Lince) and
Moody’s Investors Service.
As provided for by the reference regulations, the Bank of Italy associated the credit quality assessments
made by ECAIs with the risk weighting classes provided for under the same regulations. On 6 July 2010, the
Bank of Italy took steps to review the aforesaid associations with reference to the ratings provided by the
Cerved Group. The change, which went into effect starting 31 December 2010, has entailed an estimated
increase of approximately Euro 4.5 billion in the Group’s RWA, all other things being equal, calculated on
the basis of the activities and rating levels recorded between 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010.
Moreover, inter alia, in the wake of the recent crisis that has beset the financial markets, in the last third of
2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision approved a substantial strengthening of minimum capital
requirements as well as amendments to regulations relating to bank liquidity (Basel III), with a gradual
phasing-in of the new prudential requirements from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2019. More specifically,
the measures to reform capital-related prudential regulations can be summed up as follows: (i) banks’
minimum level of common equity, comparable to but more restrictive than the current Core Tier I ratio, will
increase from the current 2% of RWA (3.3% for Italian banks) to 7%, an amount which includes a capital
conservation buffer of 2.5%, which banks will have to accumulate gradually, still in the form of common
equity, in order to deal with possible future periods of stress (failure to observe the requirement, including
the capital conservation buffer, will entail penalties in terms of the ability to distribute profits, pay bonuses
and acquire treasury shares); (ii) the Tier I ratio will need to reach at least 8.5% of RWA, including the
capital conservation buffer indicated above, as compared to the current 4%; (iii) national authorities may
impose a possible countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% in additional Tier I Capital, when conditions are
present of an excessive growth in the volume of loans granted by the banking system; (iv) the Total Capital
ratio will need to be at least 10.5%, possibly increased up to 13% upon activation in full of the
countercyclical buffer mentioned; (v) the Tier II Capital that may be counted for purposes of reaching the
10.5% may at most represent 2% of RWA, as compared to 4% today (Tier 3 Capital, on the other hand, will
disappear).
The referenced measures to reform the liquidity regulations provide, in the first instance, for the introduction
of a short term requirement (liquidity coverage ratio), the objective of which is the creation and maintenance
of a liquidity buffer that will allow the bank to survive for thirty (30) days in the event of grave stress.
Provisions are also made for the introduction of a longer-term requirement (net stable funding ratio),
intended to ensure the bank’s endurance for one year, a period within which less liquid assets will need to be
financed by medium and long term funding.
Relative to the timing of the new prudential provisions, which will have first to be adopted by the individual
national legal systems, the Basel Committee has proposed a gradual roll-out of their effective dates, as
follows: (i) increase in common equity and Tier I Capital, and reduction in Tier II Capital, between 2013 and
2015; (ii) progressive introduction of the capital conservation buffer between 2016 and 2019; (iii) possible
introduction of a countercyclical capital buffer starting as soon as 2013; (iv) gradual introduction of new
deductions from capital for deferred tax assets (DTA), financial participations and minority interests
beginning in 2014, with an annual 20% increase until full application in 2018; (v) gradual exclusion from
Tier I Capital and Tier II Capital of debt instruments not meeting the new eligibility requirements: starting in
2013, and with a reduction of 10% a year; (vi) the two new mandatory minimum liquidity requirements
going into effect starting in 2015 (30-day liquidity coverage ratio) and 2018 (12-month net stable funding
ratio), respectively.
The reinforcement of the capital requirements, the liquidity restrictions and the increase in ratios applicable
to the Group on the basis of laws and/or regulations to be adopted in the future could have negative effects
on the Group’s operations, financial and capital position, cash flow and economic results, as well as on its
ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. With particular reference to the capital regulations, the most
significant effects for UBI Banca are expected to derive, presumably, (i) from the progressive inability to
count subordinated bond instruments, eligible under current regulations, towards Total Capital, as introduced 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
RISK FACTORS
70
by the revised prudential regulations; (ii) from the different method of calculating minority interests; and (iii)
from the treatment of deferred tax assets (DTA), the impact of which was partly attenuated as a result of the
approval of Law no. 10 of 26 February, 2011 (the so-called “Decreto Milleproroghe”). In particular,
difficulties could emerge in replacing subordinated bond instruments, no longer eligible at a given time for
Total Capital purposes, with new instruments compliant under the new prudential rules: this could make it
more difficult to comply with the new minimum capital requirements, at least as regards the capital
conservation buffer component, with consequent potential restrictions on dividend distributions. In this
regard, however, it is believed that, once completed, the Capital Increase will permit UBI Banca to
effectively anticipate the effects of the reform of the prudential regulations, substantially reducing the risk of
non-compliance with the new minimum requirements.
4.2.3 Risks connected with reduced support for systemic liquidity
The crisis on the financial markets, entailing a reduction in the liquidity available to operators, the increase in
risk premiums and, more recently, the growth in tensions associated with the foreign debt of some European
countries (Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland) has required the development of extensive initiatives in
support of the banking system, initiatives that saw the direct involvement of both States (through direct
participations taken in certain banks) and central banks (through refinancing operations against suitable
securities provided as collateral).
The ECB’s Executive Board has stated that it will continue to conduct its primary refinancing operations and
those with a maturity equal to the period for maintenance of the obligatory reserve by means of fixed-rate
auctions, with full acceptance of demand for as long as necessary and, in any event, at least until 12 July
2011. The same body has also determined that three-month operations carried out by that date shall be
conducted with the requests accepted in full and at a rate equal to the average rate for primary refinancing
operations during the time period of the operation.
An inability to obtain liquidity on the market by access to central banks with suitable collateral, or the
significant reduction or disappearance of support for the system’s liquidity on the part of the government and
central authorities could give rise to greater difficulties in obtaining liquidity on the market and/or higher
costs connected with resort to such liquidity, with possible negative effects on the operations, financial and
capital position and economic results of the UBI Banca Group.
4.3 RISK FACTORS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFER AND WITH FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS
4.3.1 Risks connected with liquidity and volatility of the financial instruments
The Option Rights and UBI Shares present elements of risk characteristic of an investment in listed financial
instruments of the same nature. Holders of such instruments may sell their investment on the MTA.
Such instruments could present liquidity problems independent of the Company. Hence, offers to sell might
not find adequate and timely counterparties and could be subject to fluctuations – including significant
fluctuations – in price. Factors such as changes in the Company’s economic, financial, capital and earnings
situation or in that of its competitors, altered general conditions in the sector in which the Company operates,
in the general economy and in the financial markets, changes in the legal and regulatory environment, as well
as dissemination by the press of news of journalistic origin relating to the Company could generate
substantial fluctuations in the price of outstanding UBI Banca shares and, possibly, of the Option Rights.
In addition, equity markets in recent years have registered somewhat unstable trends in prices and trading
volumes. Going forward, such trends could have a negative impact on the market price of UBI Banca shares
and, possibly, of the Option Rights regardless of the economic, financial and capital position that the UBI
Banca Group will achieve. The trading price of the Option Rights will depend, inter alia, on the price trends
of the outstanding UBI Banca shares and could be subject to greater volatility than the market price of the
latter. 
Section One
RISK FACTORS
71
Finally, in connection with the Offer, a number of shareholders of the Company might decide not to exercise
their Option Rights and to sell them on the market. This could have a negative effect on the market price of
the Option Rights or the shares.
(See Section Two, Chapter IV, Paragraph 4.1, and Section Two, Chapter V, Paragraph 5.2.2 of the
Prospectus).
4.3.2 Risks connected with underwriting and guarantee commitments and with partial execution of
the Capital Increase
On 28 March 2011, Mediobanca signed a pre-guarantee agreement undertaking to guarantee – under the
ususal terms and conditions for this type of transaction and up to a total maximum amount of Euro 1 billion –
the underwriting of UBI Shares in an amount corresponding to any Option Rights that might not be exercised
upon the conclusion of the Market Offer.
Under the Offer, Mediobanca and Centrobanca (the latter without taking on any guarantee commitments)
will act as Joint Global Coordinators. Mediobanca will also act as bookrunner. The market will be informed
of any potential participation of other financial institutions in the guarantee syndicate coordinated and led by
Mediobanca and Centrobanca, together with their respective roles, by means of a press release.
The guarantee agreement, which will be concluded prior to the launch of the Offer, will be drawn up in
accordance with market practice and will contain a commitment by the financial institutions participating in
the guarantee syndicate (the “Guarantors”) to underwrite the UBI Shares in an amount corresponding to
those Option Rights that might not be exercised upon the conclusion of the Market Offer up to a maximum
amount of Euro 1 billion, along with the usual clauses stipulating conditions for the guarantee commitment
to have effect or giving Mediobanca the right to revoke the Guarantors’ guarantee commitment upon the
occurrence, inter alia, of events which may prejudice the proper conclusion of the Offer (so-called “material
adverse change” or “force majeure”) or upon the occurrence of serious violations by the Company of
commitments made or guarantees given in the guarantee agreement. The agreement undertaken will be
notified to the market by means of a press release.
Should the Capital Increase fail to be fully subscribed following the Market Offer and should Mediobanca
exercise the right to cancel the guarantee commitments (and, thus, if the Capital Increase should be
implemented only for that portion subscribed as a result of the Market Offer), the purposes of the Offer
might be compromised or realised only in part.
(See Section Two, Chapter V, Paragraph 5.4.3 of the Prospectus).
4.3.3 Risks connected with the dilutive effects of the Capital Increase
In consideration of the fact that the UBI Shares are being offered under option to all the Issuer’s shareholders
and all the Bondholders and, therefore, there are no dilutive effects in terms of percentage stake in the
Issuer’s fully diluted share capital (calculated assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds and full
subscription of the Capital Increase) vis-à-vis the Issuer’s shareholders and the Bondholders who decide to
subscribe to the Offer to the extent of their entitlement. On the other hand, with reference to the percentage
stake in the actually issued share capital, the shareholders who decide to subscribe to the Offer for their
entire entitlement, shall in any event experience a maximum dilution of 2.12% should all or part of the
Bondholders decide to subscribe to the Option Rights assigned to them.
The Issuer’s shareholders who by contrast decide not to subscribe the Offer for the portion they are entitled
to, could see their stake in the actually issued capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around 29.12%.
On the other hand, considering the stake in the fully diluted capital (calculated, with reference to the situation
prior to the Offer, assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the basis of the current conversion
ratio and, with reference to the post-Offer situation, assuming full subscription of the Capital Increase), the
shareholders and the Bondholders who decide not to subscribe to the Offer for the portion of their

RISK FACTORS
72
entitlement could see their stake in the fully diluted capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around
27.59%.
(See Section Two, Chapter IX, Paragraph 9.1 of the Prospectus).
4.3.4 Risks connected with the markets in which the Offer is not permitted in the absence of
authorisation by competent authorities
The Offer is reserved exclusively to the territory of Republic of Italy, on the basis of the Prospectus.
The Prospectus does not constitute an offer of financial instruments in the United States of America, Canada,
Japan and Australia, or in any other country in which such offer is not permitted in the absence of
authorisation by the competent authorities (together with the United States of America, Canada, Japan and
Australia, the “Other Countries”).
The Offer neither is, nor shall be, promoted in the Other Countries or to parties residing therein. No financial
instrument may be offered or traded in the Other Countries in the absence of specific registration or an
exemption from registration, in accordance with the legal rules there applicable.
The UBI Shares and Option Rights have not been, nor shall they be, registered within the meaning of the
United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor within the meaning of the corresponding legal
provisions of the Other Countries, and consequently they may not be offered, sold or delivered, directly or
indirectly, in the Other Countries.
Any acceptance of the Offer made, directly or indirectly, in violation of the above restrictions shall be
deemed null and void.
Therefore, UBI Banca shareholders and Bondholders who are not located in the territory of Italy, prior to
undertaking any initiative in relation to the Offer, are requested to seek specific legal opinions in this regard
from their own advisors.

Lombarda e Piemontese (―BLP‖) under the merger deed dated 28 March 2007 drawn up under the hand and
seal of the Notary Public Armando Santus, effective from 1 April 2007.
The BPU Group
In December 2002, the Boards of Directors of Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l., Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. and Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese S.p.A., respectively,
approved the plan for the merger of the three banks within a new limited liability co-operative company,
which then became a ―società cooperativa per azioni‖ (joint-stock co-operative) known as Banche Popolari
Unite, involving the simultaneous conferral:
(i) of the banking business Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l. to Banca Popolare di
Bergamo S.p.A.;
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

(ii) of the banking businesses Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. and Banca Popolare di Luino
e di Varese S.p.A. (“BPLV”) to Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.p.A. (“BPCI”).
The aforementioned merger and conferral transactions were approved by the respective shareholders’
meetings in May 2003 and became effective as from 1 July 2003, subject to obtaining the prescribed banking
authorisations and listing of the new BPU shares on the MTA of the Borsa Italiana.
The background to the BPU Group
BPU arose from the merger of three banks (Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l., Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. and BPLV). Some of the more significant events in the history of the
three banks before the merger are illustrated below, along with a number of the most important events for the
BPU Group, post-merger.
Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l.
Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l. was founded in 1869, under the name of “Banca Mutua
Popolare della Città e Provincia di Bergamo”. From the 1980s onwards, Banca Popolare di Bergamo S.c.r.l.
extended its activities outside Lombardy, opening branches in Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Liguria
and Lazio. In 1992, Credito Varesino S.p.A. and Banca Popolare di Bergamo S.c.r.l. resolved the merger
within the new Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l.. In 1994, Banca Popolare di BergamoCredito
Varesino S.c.r.l. acquired a shareholding in the Swiss financial holding company Holding St.
François (now B.D.G. Finanziaria S.A.), which owns Banque de Dépôts et de Gestion S.A., a Swiss bank
specialised in asset management.
In 1995 and 1996, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l. acquired control over a number of
banks, including Banca Brignone S.p.A., Banca Popolare di Ancona, Banca Popolare di Todi S.p.A., Cassa di
Risparmio di Fano S.p.A. (sold off in July 2005 to the Intesa Group), and Banca Popolare Campana S.p.A.
In 1997, via the creation of BPB SIM S.p.A. (subsequently named UBI SIM S.p.A. and then absorbed within
UBI Banca Private Investment as from 1 January 2008), a network of financial advisors working in close
collaboration with the Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l. branch network, the bank
enhanced its presence in the private banking sector. In 2000, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino
S.c.r.l. acquired control over Centrobanca, with the aim of strengthening its presence in the corporate sector.
In the same year, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino S.c.r.l. established FinanzAttiva SIM S.p.A.,
FinanzAttiva Gestioni SGR S.p.A., B@nca 24-7 and Mercato Impresa S.p.A.
Before the merger with Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. and Banca Popolare di Luino e di
Varese S.p.A., the Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino Group had 650 branches, total assets of over
Euro 42 billion and around 1.4 million customers.
Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l.
Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. was founded in Milan in 1888.
The development and expansion of Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria started after the end of the
second world war, by means of the merger and acquisition of a number of financial institutions and Italian
and foreign bank branches, including Banca Popolare di Codogno S.c.r.l. in 1977, Credito Lodigiano in
1980, Banca Popolare di Vigevano S.c.r.l. in 1991, a business unit of American Express Bank Ltd. in 1997
and 17 branches of Banco di Napoli in 1998.
In 1996, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria acquired control of BPLV. During the same year, the Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria Banking Group was created.
In 1998, the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Group established Banca Popolare Commercio e
Industria International S.A., a bank with headquarters in Luxembourg operating in the private banking sector,
subsequently renamed BPU International S.A.
In 2001, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria acquired 75% of Banca Carime. 
Section One
75
In 2002, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria created an exclusive partnership with Commercial Union
Vita S.p.A. in the bancassurance sector. The agreement established:
 a joint venture entitled Aviva Vita S.p.A., operating in the life assurance sector for the distribution of
products via the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria S.c.r.l. Group branch network; and
 the acquisition by Commercial Union Vita S.p.A. of a shareholding in the capital of a number of banks
in the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Group.
Before the merger with Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese S.p.A. and Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito
Varesino, the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Group had 550 branches, 37 private banking units, total
assets of over Euro 20 billion and around 1.2 million customers.
Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese S.p.A.
Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese S.p.A. was founded in 1885. Following the take-over bid made by
Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese S.c.r.l. was transformed from a
limited liability co-operative into a joint-stock company in 1996 and joined the Banca Popolare Commercio e
Industria Group.
Before the merger with Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino and Banca Popolare Commercio e
Industria, the Banca Popolare di Luino Group had over 59 branches and 8 private banking units.
The Banca Lombarda e Piemontese Group
The BLP Group – one of the leading Italian banking groups – was mainly active in Lombardy and Piedmont
and essentially in the provinces of Brescia, Cuneo, Pavia and Alessandria. The organisational structure of the
BLP Group was based on a federal model with the parent company responsible primarily for strategic
planning and for other centralised functions, the commercial banks and the other subsidiary companies
operating throughout the area under their own brands.
The structure of the BLP Group originated from the merger which took place in 1998, of Credito Agrario
Bresciano S.p.A. (“CAB”) with Banca San Paolo di Brescia S.p.A. (“Banca San Paolo”), and from
subsequent corporate acquisitions.
As from the end of the 1980s, CAB – founded in 1883 – acquired numerous local banks consolidating its
position throughout the area it operated in. In 1978, CAB shares were listed on the Milan Mercato Ristretto
and, in 1995, on the MTA.
Banca San Paolo was established in 1888. In the following years, the bank progressively developed the
lending activity areas, diversifying, among other aspects, in the segments of asset management and nonbanking
financial services, consolidating its institutional role as a reference bank on the geographic markets
where it was most deeply rooted.
In 1996, Banca San Paolo shares were listed on the MTA.
In November 1998, Banca San Paolo and CAB’s extraordinary shareholders’ meetings approved the merger
via incorporation of Banca San Paolo within CAB and the consequent renaming of the absorbing bank as
Banca Lombarda S.p.A., effective as from 31 December 1998.
In line with the reference federal model, in 1998 CAB and Banca San Paolo set up a new company known as
Banco di Brescia San Paolo CAB S.p.A. which was transferred the majority of the commercial banking
activities headed up by Banca Lombarda.
Following the merger between Banca San Paolo and CAB, the BLP Group made a number of acquisitions
and established new companies, including:
 the acquisition of Banca Cassa di Risparmio di Tortona S.p.A.; 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

Veneta Factoring S.p.A. was absorbed within CBI Factor S.p.A.;
 the acquisition of Electrolux Financiera S.A., a Spanish company essentially operating in the factoring
segment, which subsequently adopted the name Financiera Veneta S.A.;
 the acquisition of Artesia Bank Luxembourg S.A., a Luxembourg-based bank specialised in private

renamed Banca Lombarda Private Investment;
 the acquisition, via Banca Lombarda International S.A., of Caboto International S.A., a Swiss
company involved in portfolio management, subsequently renamed Gestioni Lombarda (Suisse) S.A.
Main events following the creation of UBI Banca
On 1 May 2007, the transfer of a business unit made up of 15 Banca Carime branches to Banca Popolare
Pugliese became effective.
Again in May 2007, IW Bank shares were listed for trading on the Expandi market organised and run by
Borsa Italiana, which then was incorporated in the MTA from 2009 onwards.
On 13 November 2007, UBI Banca and International Investments, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc.
(USA), entered into a framework agreement for the extension of the UBI Pramerica joint venture to the sales
network belonging to the former Banca Lombarda Group, by means of the conferral in favour of UBI
Pramerica, on 18 January 2008, of Capitalgest S.p.A.’s and Capitalgest Alternative Investments SGR S.p.A.’s
asset management activities and consequent UBI Pramerica capital increase.
On 31 December 2007, the UBI Banca Group sold off 61 branches to Banca Popolare di Vicenza (11 Banca
Popolare di Bergamo branches, 32 Banco di Brescia branches and 18 Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria
branches). This sale took place in accordance with the provisions of the Italian Antitrust Authority dated 12
April 2007. The countervalue of the transaction came to Euro 488 million.
In January 2008, UBI Banca transferred a 50% shareholding plus one share in the capital of the subsidiary
UBI Assicurazioni Vita S.p.A. to the Aviva Group, for a price of Euro 65 million (for a total valuation of the
company of Euro 130 million), effective as from 18 June 2008.
On 18 January 2008, the conferrals envisaged by the framework agreement entered into in November 2007
with International Investments S.A. were carried out and the reorganisation of the Italian asset management
activities of the UBI Banca Group was completed. Following this reorganisation (which also included the
transfer by the Group of around 12% of the capital of UBI Pramerica post-increase in favour of Prudential
USA, for a price of Euro 105 million), UBI Pramerica (65% owned by the UBI Banca Group and 35% by
Prudential USA) became the Group management company which heads up the two alternative asset
management companies, UBI Pramerica Alternative Investments SGR S.p.A. and Capitalgest Alternative
Investments SGR S.p.A., wholly-owned subsidiaries.

During 2008, migration of the former BPU Network Banks onto the Group IT system took place, as follows:
BPCI 22-24 February, BPA 25-27 April, Carime 4-6 July, BPB 3-5 October, UBI Banca 8-9 November.
Over the year, the process for the integration/rationalisation of the Product Companies was also completed,
leading among other things to the transactions described above and to:
- the incorporation of UBI SIM within UBI Banca Private Investment, effective as from 1 January
2008;
- the partial spin-off in favour of B@nca 24-7 of the business unit comprising the product company
activities of SILF S.p.A., effective as from 1 January 2008. SILF S.p.A. now operates as a sales
network for B@nca 24-7 products;
- the merger via incorporation of BPU Leasing in SBS Leasing (now UBI Leasing), effective as from
5 July 2008;
- the merger via incorporation of Plurifid S.p.A. in Solofid Società Lombarda Fiduciaria S.p.A., which
led to the creation of UBI Fiduciaria S.p.A., effective as from 1 October 2008.
Again over the year, structural measures were completed aimed at transforming the Group’s foreign banks,
UBI Banca International Lussemburgo and Banque de Dépôts et de Gestion S.A., in the two reference hubs
respectively for corporate customers and for the private customers of the Group, concentrating all the foreign
shareholdings in the same.
Recent developments
Development of the online trading and banking activities via an increase in the IW Bank investment
On 4 March 2009, UBI Banca launched a project for the enhancement and further development of its online
trading and banking activities by means of: (i) the purchase of a further 32.4% stake in the capital of the
subsidiary IW Bank, and (ii) the launch of a business integration project between IW Bank and Twice SIM
S.p.A., in which Medinvest International S.A. held the majority of the capital. Further to this transaction,
Medinvest International S.A., via Webstar S.A., acquired a 10.3% shareholding from Centrobanca in IW
Bank’s capital.
Acquisition of a branch network from Intesa Sanpaolo
On 16 March 2009, the acquisition of the Intesa Sanpaolo business unit made up of 13 branches in the
province of La Spezia, was finalised. With a view to ensuring the observance of the capital requirements
established by the Regulatory Authority, on 13 March 2009 the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of Banco
di San Giorgio, indicated as purchaser of the branches, approved a capital strengthening plan for a total of
Euro 75 million.
Optimisation of the capital structure
In April 2009, UBI Banca approved a number of measures aimed at qualifying and optimising the capital
structure.
In this context:
- on 15 April 2009, UBI Banca announced a public exchange offer on the entire amount of the
preferred securities outstanding (with a nominal value of Euro 570 million) and on 5 series of lower
tier II bonds (with a nominal value of Euro 1.550 million euro), in return for senior debt securities
for a maximum amount of 1.570 million euro to be issued under the existing EMTN (European
Medium Term Notes) programme (the “Public Exchange Offer”). The Public Exchange Offer
concerned: i) the entire amount of the preferred securities (Euro 570 million) and the Lower Tier II
bonds maturing as at 30 June 2009 (Euro 250 million); and ii) the remaining 4 issues of Lower Tier
II bonds, up to a maximum of Euro 750 million, with a possible partial allotment if applications
exceeded that amount. Investors accepting the offer were given senior debt securities in exchange 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
78
with maturity 25 June 2014 and a fixed annual coupon of 4.939%. The finalisation of the transaction
took place on 25 June 2009: adhesions to the exchange offer amounted to a nominal Euro 640.45
million (of which Euro 116.5 million concerning preferred securities) which, on the basis of the
established exchange ratios, led UBI Banca to issue senior securities for a total of Euro 850 million,
inclusive of an additional amount to ensure greater liquidity for the issue; and
 the issue of a convertible bond was approved, to be offered under option to the shareholders (the
“Convertible Bond” or “CB”). The issue of the Convertible Bonds amounted in total to Euro
639,145,872, via the issue of 50,129,088 Convertible Bonds with a par value of Euro 12.75 each,
offered under option to the shareholders at a ratio of 4 Convertible Bonds for each 51 ordinary shares
held. The issue price of each Convertible Bond was set at par, corresponding to Euro 12.75. The
Convertible Bonds have a fixed coupon of 5.75% gross per annum and a duration from 10 July 2009
to 10 July 2013 (see Section One, Chapter XXI). The offer, which took place between 22 June and
10 July 2009, concluded with the subscription of 97.74% of the Convertible Bonds offered, while the
remaining 2.26% was subscribed through market offering. On 20 July 2009, trading of the
Convertible Bonds on the MTA commenced.
 At the same time, the issue of warrants was resolved, to be offered free of charge under option to the
Issuer’s shareholders, entitled “Warrant Azioni Ordinarie UBI Banca 2009-2011” (UBI Banca
2009/2011 warrants). (See Section One, Chapter XXI).
The geographic optimisation project
At the end of September 2009, the Group approved a geographic optimisation project for the Network Banks
(the “Optimisation Project”) so as to make the Group’s distribution structure more efficient, by means of
the specialisation of the individual Network Banks by geographic area, with focus on the traditional areas of
presence. The project was launched in January 2010 after having obtained the necessary authorisation from
the competent authorities and following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Trade
Unions.
Within the sphere of this project, virtually exclusive geographic coverage was assigned to each Network
Bank, by means of the grouping together of the Group branches present in the same area under a single
reference brand, involving a consequent increase in the market shares and the visibility of each individual
Network Bank as well as parallel streamlining of the commercial growth and loan management processes.
The transaction led to the transfer of 316 branches and around 2,200 resources within the Group, between
Banca Regionale Europea, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di
Brescia and Banco di San Giorgio.
The Optimisation Project was concluded on 27 July 2010, the date when UBI Banca reacquired the cross
minority holdings which the individual Network Banks ended up holding further to the conferrals made, with
the re-establishment of the original shareholding set-ups of the parent company in the Network Banks,
except for a reorganisation of the presence of the two Foundations (Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo Foundation
and Banca del Monte di Lombardia Foundation) so as to take into account the new focus of the Network
Banks on the traditional areas of said Foundations. In fact, the Banca del Monte di Lombardia Foundation
exited the holding structure of Banca Regionale Europea, and invested in the capital of Banca Popolare
Commercio e Industria. The Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo Foundation remained in the holding structure of
Banca Regionale Europea – focused on the north-western area – with a shareholding which increased from
20% to 25% and an investment of around Euro 125 million (see Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.3).
Rationalisation of the Aviva Group shareholdings in the Network Banks
At the same time as the geographic rationalisation and streamlining project, the UBI Banca Group took steps
to develop the bancassurance activities and to reorganise the shareholding structure of the Aviva Group in the
Network Banks by means of the acquisition by the Aviva Group of a shareholding in Banca Popolare di
Ancona and the reduction of its holdings in Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria and Banca Carime (see
Section One, Chapter XXII, Paragraph 22.1).

Partnership with Fortis and BNP Paribas Assurance in the non-life insurance sector
On 29 December 2009, a partnership was created in the non-life insurance sector with Fortis and BNP
Paribas Assurance, via the disposal of the majority holding (50% plus one share) in UBI Assicurazioni to a
vehicle invested in by the above companies (see Section One, Chapter XXII, Paragraph 22.2). This
partnership permitted the UBI Banca Group, inter alia, to expand and diversify the offer in the non-life
sector by means of the distribution of high added value products, further extending the commercial range in
the segments other than the motor one; to benefit from the business expertise of the partners also in terms of
product innovation; and to implement commercial strategies aimed at maximising the potential offered by the
bundling and cross selling of credit protection products and non-life insurance products, to be sold together
with banking products.
Acquisition of the entire share capital of UBI Pramerica Alternative Investments SGR S.p.A. (now absorbed
within UBI Pramerica)
On 19 March 2010, UBI Pramerica reacquired 3.75% of the capital of UBI Pramerica Alternative
Investments SGR S.p.A. from the latter’s management, and thereby obtained the entire share capital. The
acquisition was preparatory to the merger via incorporation of UBI Pramerica Alternative Investments SGR
S.p.A. and Capitalgest Alternative Investments SGR S.p.A., (a subsidiary of UBI Pramerica), within UBI
Pramerica as resolved by the respective shareholders’ meetings on 30 March 2010. The merger – authorised
by the Bank of Italy in February 2010 – was effective as from 1 July 2010, while for accounting and tax
purposes it was effective as from 1 January 2010 (see Section One, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6.1.4.4). The
transfer (for Euro 560 thousand) to UBI Pramerica Alternative Investments SGR S.p.A. of the entire
shareholding in UBI Management Company S.A., held by UBI Banca Private Investment (99%) and by UBI
Banca International (1%) also took place on 3 August 2010.
Acquisition of Barberini S.A. and Prestitalia S.p.A., active in the consumer credit sector
On 24 March 2010, UBI Banca strengthened its presence in the consumer credit sector, by means of entering
into an agreement for the purchase of the entire capital of Barberini S.A. and, via the same, Prestitalia S.p.A..
Within the same context, commitments were also formalised with the partner agents of Prestitalia S.p.A. on
an exclusive basis for the distribution of “salary-backed loan” and “deduction of loan repayment from
salary” products. Also, in order to proceed with the necessary capital strengthening plan (as per the
provisions of the Bank of Italy dated 3 March 2010), a capital increase for Prestitalia S.p.A. totalling Euro 37
million was also subscribed, via Barberini S.A.. On 10 January 2011, Barberini S.A. sold the entire
shareholding in Prestitalia S.p.A. to B@nca 24-7 (see Section One, Chapter XXII, Paragraph 22.3).
Trade union procedure
So as to further optimise the related operating risk, concentrating on and investing in the typical activities for
the supply of products/services to customers, on 20 May 2010 a trade union procedure concluded for the
purpose of achieving a significant reduction in costs and, in particular, in structural personnel expenses,
through a reduction in the Group’s overall workforce by 895 units (see Section One, Chapter XVII,
Paragraph 17.1).
Transfer of the custodian bank and correspondent bank activities to RBC Dexia
On 31 May 2010, so as to focus further on the typical supply of banking products to customers, UBI Banca
transferred the business unit relating to its custodian bank activities to RBC Dexia Investor Services (over
Euro 19 billion in administered assets, mainly linked to the mutual fund management activities carried out by
the subsidiary UBI Pramerica), along with the correspondent bank activities, by means of the transfer of a
number of agreements pertaining to Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria for the supply of paying agent
services in Italy to Luxembourgian SICAVs and Irish UCITS (see Section One, Chapter XXII, Paragraph
22.4).
Strengthening of the partnership with the Cattolica Group in the life assurance sector
During 2010, the partnership with Cattolica Assicurazioni in the life assurance sector was also reinforced, in
the first instance extending the duration of the same until 2020, and subsequently transferring Cattolica 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
80
Assicurazioni a further holding of 9.9% in the capital of the joint venture (Lombarda Vita S.p.A.), which as
at the Prospectus Date was 60% owned by Cattolica Assicurazioni and 40% by UBI Banca. In this context, it
was also envisaged that the distribution of the insurance products of the joint venture be carried out
exclusively by the branches of the Network Banks of the former Banca Lombarda Group (Banco di Brescia,
Banca Regionale Europea, Banca della Valle Camonica, Banco di San Giorgio) (see Section One, Chapter
XXII, Paragraph 22.5).
Rationalisation of the international presence
Once again during 2010, a number of measures were adopted on the international front aimed at improving
the Group’s focus and enhancing the commercial potential. In particular, Banque de Dépôts et de Gestion
S.A. was reorganised and focused on the private banking segment, and its geographic presence was reduced
to concentrate operations on the most relevant markets. In this context: (i) the presence in Canton Ticino was
rationalised with the closure in June of the Mendrisio branch and the incorporation, as from 31 October, of
the subsidiary Gestioni Lombarda Suisse Sa; (ii) the transfer of the Neuchâtel and Yverdon branches to the
Swiss banking group Valiant was finalised, effective as from 31 December 2010, mainly involving retail
activities, thereby generating a capital gain of CHF 8.3 million (around Euro 6.6 million); and (iii) a capital
increase was resolved in December for CHF 4 million (around Euro 3.1 million), finalised in January 2011,
in favour of the subsidiary BDG Singapore Private Ltd which, after having obtained the “Capital Markets
Services” licence in October, launched asset management activities. As from 10 December 2010, the
Luxembourg branch of Banco di Brescia was transferred to UBI Banca International S.A. thereby
rationalising the presence in Luxembourg by means of aggregation between two entities already operative
with a high degree of integration. UBI Banca International S.A. took over from the Banco di Brescia branch
the short-term institutional funding activities, carried out through the issue of both French certificates of
deposit and Euro Commercial Paper.
Renewal of the partnership with the Aviva Group in the life assurance sector
On 21 December 2010, the UBI Banca Group and the Aviva Group agreed to renew the strategic partnership
in the life assurance sector, due to expire at year end, until 31 December 2015, maintaining the contractual
conditions unchanged. In this context, it was also envisaged that the distribution of Aviva Vita S.p.A.’s
insurance products be carried out through the branches of Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca
Popolare di Bergamo and Banca Carime and that the distribution of Aviva Assicurazioni Vita S.p.A.’s
insurance products be carried out through the branches of Banca Popolare di Ancona.
Take-over bid on IW Bank
On 27 October 2010, UBI Banca and Webstar S.A. informed the market of the exceeding of the threshold of
90% of IW Bank’s capital and their intention not to re-establish the float of the IW bank shares and,
consequently, to fulfil the purchase obligation on the residual IW Bank shares pursuant to Article 108 (2) of
the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF). The purchase obligation on IW Bank shares was acquitted by UBI
Banca, also on behalf of Webstar S.A.. The procedure concluded on 19 April 2011, the date when UBI Banca
– availing itself of the right to purchase as per Article 111 (1) of the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) – took
steps to formally communicate to IW Bank, pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 111 (3) of the
Consolidated Finance Act (TUF), the deposit of the purchase price, equating to Euro 2.043 for each IW Bank
share, care of Centrobanca which acted as intermediary appointed with the co-ordination of the raising of the
sales requests on the MTA. As from 19 April 2011, ordinary IW Bank shares were delisted from the MTA.

EMTN programme
The UBI Banca Group has an EMTN Programme for medium/long-term issues intended for institutional
investors and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The total amount of this programme is Euro 15 billion
and the current amount used comes to Euro 9,932 million (the outstanding total under EMTN also including
the old former Banca Lombarda programme comes to Euro 11,788 million). 
Section One
81
In particular, since 2007 the Group has carried out the following issues: (i) on 24 July 2007, it issued a senior
7-year bond for a total of Euro 750 million at a floating rate (variable coupon, with a reoffer yield equal to
the 3-month Euribor rate increased by 20 bps); (ii) in 2007, it carried out a private placement amounting to
Euro 130 million, already fully repaid; (iii) in 2008, it carried out two senior bond issues amounting to Euro

(v) in 2009 it carried out 11 private placement transactions for a total of around Euro 2,800 million; (vi) on 5
March 2010, it issued a 3-year senior bond, at a floating rate, amounting to Euro 700 million (with a reoffer
yield equal to the 3-month Euribor rate increased by 73 bps); (vii) on 5 November 2010, it issued a 2-year
senior bond at a floating rate for a total of Euro 1 billion (with a reoffer yield equal to the 3-month Euribor

the mid swap); (x) on 18 March 2011, it carried out a private placement of 3-year senior bonds amounting to
Euro 8 million (with a coupon of 4.44%); (xi) on 21 April 2011, it issued a 2.5-year senior bond amounting
to Euro 1 billion (at a fixed-rate with coupon equating to 4.125%, and a reoffer spread of 160 bps above the
mid swap).
Covered Bonds
In 2008, UBI Banca’s Management Board resolved to go ahead with the creation of an “Obbligazioni
Bancarie Garantite” issue programme (so-called Covered Bonds), structured in accordance with Italian
legislation (Law no. 80 dated 14 May 2005, Decree of the Ministry for the Economy and Finance no. 310
dated 14 December 2006 (Regulation implementing Article 7 bis of Italian Law no. 130 dated 30 April 1999,
concerning covered bonds) and the Regulatory Instructions issued by the Bank of Italy dated May 2007),
targeted at benefiting, in funding terms, of lower funding costs compared to the cost of uncovered issues
(senior EMTN).
The UBI Banca Group launched a covered bond issue programme for an amount of Euro 10 billion. The
structure adopted envisages that the portfolios which make up the separate assets of the special purpose
entity be transferred by several banks, the so-called originators (that is the transferring banks), other than the
issuing bank.
Accordingly, a special purpose entity was set up, UBI Finance S.r.l. (company established in pursuance of
Italian Law no. 130 dated 30 April 1999) which, acting as guarantor of the issues made by UBI Banca, took
over a portfolio of residential mortgage loans transferred by the Group’s Network Banks taking part in the
programme both as originator banks and financing banks.
The role of master servicer, calculation agent and cash manager for the transaction is performed by UBI
Banca, while that of Paying Agent is performed by the Bank of New York (Luxembourg) S.A.; the
Bondholders’ Representative is BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited.
The programme dealers are a number of leading international banks: Barclays Capital, Crédit Agricole CIB,
Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank AG, ING Commercial Banking, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg,
Natixis, Nomura and Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking.
UBI Banca delegates the originator banks, acting as sub-servicers, with the servicing activities associated
with the handling of the collections and relations with the customers relating to the portfolio transferred by
each originator bank; the transferring banks also perform the role of swap counterparts in the balance
guarantee swaps entered into with the special purpose entity so as to normalise the cash flows generated by
the mortgage loan portfolio.
The first transfers of mortgage loans by two Group banks, Banco di Brescia and Banca Regionale Europea,
were carried out in July 2008 for a total value of around Euro 2 billion as at that date.
These transfers were followed, at the end of 2009, by Banca Popolare di Bergamo joining the programme as
well, transferring a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio to service the second issue, again for Euro 1 billion,
in December 2009, once again with the assistance of Barclays Capital as arranger of the entire programme. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

In 2009, two issues of covered bank bonds were carried out: the first, on 23 September 2009, with a 7-year
duration, amounting to Euro 1 billion (at a fixed-rate with a coupon of 3.625%); the second on 16 December
2009, with a 10-year duration, amounting to Euro 1 billion (at a fixed-rate with a coupon of 4%). Both the
issues received AAA/Aaa rating from Fitch and Moody’s.
In May 2010, Banco di San Giorgio and Banca Popolare di Ancona also joined the Covered Bond
programme, transferring their assets in the third transfer transaction which also involved the originator banks
already participating in the programme. As a result of this transaction, carried out on 1 May 2010, assets
were transferred for a total of Euro 2.7 billion.
In 2010, two covered bond issues were carried out: the first, a private placement (fully subscribed by the EIB
– European Investment Bank – following the implementation of a framework agreement between EIB and
the UBI Banca Group for the disbursement of medium/long-term loans for small and medium-sized
companies) issued on 30 April 2010, with a duration of 12 years, for a total of Euro 250 million (with sixmonthly
coupon at floating rate); the second issued on 15 September 2010, with a maturity of 7 years,
amounting to Euro 1 billion (fixed-rate with coupon of 3.375%). These issues also received AAA/Aaa rating
from Fitch and Moody’s, respectively.
During the last quarter of 2010, participation in the programme was finalised by the Network Banks, thanks
to the transfer of mortgage loan portfolios by Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Carime, Banca
di Valle Camonica and UBI Banca Private Investment S.p.A. on 1 October, for a total of Euro 2.4 billion.
Again in October 2010, a further public issue was made for Euro 500 million, with a duration of five years
and a fixed coupon of 3.125%. This issue also received the maximum rating from Fitch (AAA) and Moody’s
(Aaa).
The portfolio guaranteeing the issues, which in the accounts has remained recorded under the assets of each
transferring bank, amounted as at 31 December 2010 to around Euro 7.7 billion in residual capital debt.
During 2010, the portfolio generated total collections for around 1.2 billion, divided up between the
portfolios of the various originators as follows:

During the first few months of 2011, another two covered bonds public issues were made: the first, on 28
January 2011 for Euro 1 billion, with a duration of 10 years (at a fixed-rate and coupon of 5.250%); the
second, on 22 February 2011 for a total of Euro 750 million, maturing in 5 years (at a fixed-rate and coupon
of 4.500%). These first two issues of 2011 also received the maximum rating from Fitch (AAA) and
Moody’s (Aaa).
As at the Prospectus Date, the limit of Euro 10,000 million had been used for a total of Euro 5,500 million.

Other goodwill 75 75 194 - -119
TOTAL 4,416,659 4,416,660 4,401,911 -1 14,749
The goodwill recorded in the UBI Banca Group’s consolidated financial statements (so-called “consolidation
differences” deriving from the elimination of the investment in the consolidated subsidiary as at the date of
first time consolidation) is the result of all the goodwill and positive consolidation differences relating to
certain UBI Banca subsidiary companies.
Specifically, the goodwill recorded in the UBI Banca financial statements (Euro 521.2 million as at 31
December 2010, unchanged as at 31 March 2011) was the consequence of the merger between the former
Banche Popolari Unite Group and the former Banca Lombarda e Piemontese Group on 1 April 2007. The
aforementioned transaction was recognised – on the basis of the provisions laid down by the IFRS 3 standard
– in accordance with the so-called purchase method, where the purchaser (BPU) allocated the cost of the
transaction at fair value of the assets and liabilities of the entity acquired (BLP) recording the balance
remaining after allocation in the item “goodwill”.
With regard to the Optimisation Project (so-called branch switch) concluded on 25 January 2010, the
differences shown at goodwill level regarding the individual Network Banks concerned fully offset each
other, with the exception of a difference of Euro 110 thousand which refers to Banca Regionale Europea and
is due to the goodwill recorded in relation to the opening of a branch in Antibes, France. 
Section One
85
Another increase worth mentioning is that relating to UBI Pramerica concerning the incorporation of
Capitalgest Alternative Investments in UBI Pramerica so as to streamline the Group structure with the
consequent elimination of costs and structure overlappings. This increase offsets the consequent reduction in
the goodwill relating to Capitalgest Alternative Investments.
The total goodwill as at 31 March 2011 shows a difference of Euro 1 thousand compared with the end of
2010 due to an adjustment relating to the positive consolidation difference of Centrobanca S.p.A.
Other “intangible assets with a specified duration” – amounting to Euro 1,058,688 thousand as at 31
December 2010 and Euro 1,035,632 thousand as at 31 March 2011 – mainly comprise:
 trademarks for a total of Euro 337,861 thousand as at 31 December 2010 (and Euro 333,168 thousand
as at 31 March 2011) originating from the PPA carried out on 1 April 2007 following the merger of the
BPU Banca and Banca Lombarda e Piemontese Banking Groups;
 the so-called “core deposits” in other words those intangible assets linked to the relationship with the
customers, for a total of Euro 324,992 thousand as at 31 December 2010 (and Euro 304,730 thousand as
at 31 March 2011). These assets, deriving from the aforementioned PPA and that relating to Banco di San
Giorgio further to the acquisition, at the start of 2009, of the business unit comprising 13 Intesa Sanpaolo
S.p.A. branches, have a specified useful life and are subject to systematic amortisation on the basis of a
related plan which takes into account the probability of closing the current accounts;
 the so-called “AUM” or those assets linked to asset management relating to both production and
distribution activities for a total of Euro 165,008 thousand as at 31 December 2010 (and Euro 161,399
thousand as at 31 March 2011).These assets, deriving from the PPA, are amortised over the residual
useful life of the relationship with the customers;
 “assets under custody” for a total of Euro 54,097 thousand as at 31 December 2010 (and Euro 52,810
thousand as at 31 March 2011);
 the residual balance is attributable (i) to the software, mainly allocated to UBISS S.c.p.A., a UBI Banca
Group service company. Software is amortised over 3 years; and (ii) for the residual amount of Euro
21,018 thousand as at 31 December 2010 (and Euro 20,267 thousand as at 31 March 2011) which
pertains to the separation – from the value of the investment acquired in By You S.p.A. – of the
intangible assets representative of the enhancement of the benefits of the relationships established with
the customers. The original value came to Euro 29.9 million, while the useful life was defined over a tenyear
period years on the basis of the average duration of the mortgage loans.

The UBI Banca Group financial statements only include equity investments carried at equity; the jointly
owned subsidiaries are not carried at equity, but consolidated on a proportional basis.
As at 31 December 2010, out of a total of Euro 369 million (Euro 378 million as at 31 March 2011) in
investments in companies subject to significant influence, around Euro 328 million (Euro 297 million as at
31 March 2011) concerned the insurance sector.
These investments were subject to an impairment test, in some cases using the average of the multiples of a
sample of comparable companies while in others the presence of market transactions during the last year was
taken as reference.

Additional information regarding the market values referring to the more significant equity investments
present in UBI Banca’s consolidated financial statements is hereby provided. Furthermore, with regard to the
insurance companies Aviva Assicurazioni Vita S.p.A., Aviva Vita S.p.A. and Lombarda Vita S.p.A., the
market value has been determined taking into consideration a sample of insurance companies listed on active
European stock markets considering the price/book value (P/BV) multiple adjusted for the minority interests
and for the intangible assets. Bloomberg was the source for the values used. The equity value was compared
with the value of the equity investment stated in the consolidated financial statements.
 Aviva Vita Assicurazioni S.p.A.: the Group share of the equity, totalling Euro 53.6 million (Euro 54.1
million as at 31 March 2011), inclusive of the profit as at 31 December 2010 as well as a positive
consolidation difference of Euro 2.6 million, compares with an equity value (pro rata) of Euro 67.2
million;
 Aviva Vita S.p.A.: the Group share of the equity, totalling Euro 76.4 million (Euro 83.4 million as at 31
March 2011), inclusive of the profit as at 31 December 2010, compares with an equity value (pro rata) of
Euro 104.7 million;
 Lombarda Vita S.p.A.: the Group share of the equity, totalling Euro 159.2 million (159.7 million as at 31
March 2011), inclusive of the profit as at 31 December 2010 and a positive consolidation difference of
Euro 36.6 million, compares with an equity value (pro rata) of Euro 163.3 million.
With regard to UBI Assicurazioni, the Group share of the equity amounts to Euro 38.7 million, inclusive of
the year end result and a positive consolidation difference of Euro 5.6 million. The analysis of the
performance, during the year, of the market multiples of comparable listed insurance companies and the
comparable transaction multiples achieved in the sector, reveals that the book value of the investment
appears fair.

6.1.3.1 The Network Banks
The UBI Banca Group carries out its activity within Italy mainly through the branches of the Network
Banks.
The Group’s Network Banks are: (i) Banca Popolare di Bergamo, (ii) Banco di Brescia, (iii) Banca Popolare
Commercio e Industria, (iv) Banca Regionale Europea, (v) Banca Popolare di Ancona, (vi) Banca Carime,
(vii) Banca di Valle Camonica, (viii) Banco di San Giorgio, (ix) UBI Banca Private Investment.
At the end of September 2009, the Group approved a geographic optimisation project referring to the
Network Banks, which aims to make the Group’s distribution structure more efficient through specialisation
of the individual Network Banks by geographic area, with a focus on their traditional areas of reference (the
“Optimisation Project”).
The Optimisation Project began in January 2010 after having received the required authorisations by the
competent Authorities and following signature of a memorandum of understanding with the labour unions.
As part of the above-mentioned Optimisation Project, more or less exclusive geographic coverage was
attributed to each Network Bank, through regrouping of the Group branches present in the same territory
under a single brand, with a consequent increase in the market shares and the visibility of each Network
Bank and concurrent simplification of the commercial development and credit management processes. This
operation involved the intragroup transferral of 316 branches and approximately 2,200 employees among
Banca Regionale Europea, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di
Brescia and Banco di San Giorgio.
In particular, Banca Regionale Europea became the leading bank for the Piedmont region (with transferral of
its general management from Milan to Turin); Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria became the leading
bank in Lombardy within the provinces of Milan and Pavia and in the Emilia Romagna provinces of
Bologna, Parma, Piacenza, Modena, Reggio Emilia and Ferrara; Banca Popolare di Bergamo became the
leading bank in the provinces of Bergamo, Varese, Como, Lecco and Monza-Brianza; Banco di Brescia
became the leading bank in the provinces of Brescia, Lodi, Cremona, Mantua and Triveneto; finally Banco
San Giorgio became the leading bank in the region of Liguria. The current geographic focus of Banca
Popolare di Ancona, Banca Carime and Banca di Valle Camonica was confirmed. By virtue of the realisation
of the project, the UBI Banca Network Banks now operate under only one brand in 74 of the 78 provinces in
which they are present.
The branch transferrals took place through business unit conferrals (a total of 14).
As a result, 37 Group branches, whether resulting from transferrals or pre-existing, were re-qualified as minibranches
under one parent branch, within a “cluster” structure. In particular, this involved 16 branches of the
Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, 14 branches of Banca Popolare di Bergamo, six branches of Banca
Regionale Europea and one branch of Banco di Brescia.
The Optimisation Project was concluded on 27 July 2010, the date when UBI Banca reacquired the cross
minority holdings which the individual Network Banks ended up holding further to the conferrals made, with
the re-establishment of the original shareholding set-ups of the parent company in the Network Banks,
except for a reorganisation of the presence of the two Foundations (Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo Foundation
and Banca del Monte di Lombardia Foundation) so as to take into account the new focus of the Network
Banks on the traditional areas of said Foundations. In fact, the Banca del Monte di Lombardia Foundation
exited the holding structure of Banca Regionale Europea, and by contrast invested in the capital of Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria. The Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo Foundation remained in the holding
structure of Banca Regionale Europea – focused on the north-western area – with a shareholding which
increased from 20% to 25% and an investment of around Euro 125 million

international markets.
6.1.3.3 Remote channels
The UBI Banca Group also operates through remote channels such as:
 Internet Banking;
 Contact Centres;
 Interbank Corporate Banking;
 ATMs;
 POSs;
Through these channels, the Group is able to ensure that the Network Banks cover customers’ requirements
for autonomy, rapidity and transparency by providing a wide range of services.
The following are available among the channels provided for customers:
- the QUI UBI Internet banking service, which allows customers to receive information on their banking
position and to carry out numerous payment and investment transactions under secure, rapid and
economic conditions. The “Affari” version which is dedicated to small business customers, provides
further specific functionalities for single bank management by companies such as the payment of
single or multiple bills of exchange and the management of commercial portfolios;
- the QUI UBI Contact Centre combines traditional services that are accessible by telephone
(information, order collection and payment instructions) with support activities for customers, whether
potential or actual, and an activity involving consultancy and commercial development; 
Section One
97
- a network consisting of approximately 2.500 ATMs, including over 300 equipped for paying in
banknotes and cheques in addition to normal consultation, withdrawal and payment functions.
The corporate banking services are dedicated to corporate customers. These services provided by the Group
allow companies to remotely manage all their banking and interbank relations in an efficient and integrated
manner, whether these involve one or several banks, while also providing the possibility of configuration for
use by single companies or by corporate groups. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the migration to the new target
platform for interbank corporate banking was concluded, redefining the offer based on the actual necessities
of the final users. Single bank Small Economic Operator businesses (“POE”), i.e., the companies with less

requirements of these counterparties while the offering to the Corporate and Small Business segments
focused on QUI UBI Imprese, the Group’s CBI multi-bank product.
Consequently, at the end of December the UBI Banca Group had over 146,000 companies connected on the
CBI channel, confirming the growth trend in the number of payment and collection orders given remotely.
As at the date of the Prospectus, the Group had over 61,000 POSs installed at businesses. In 2010, Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria participated in the pilot initiative of connecting POS terminals with
contactless technology in the Milan area, which accepts low amount payments through the use of special
payment cards, (so-called “micro payments”) with rapidity and security given that the transaction is
concluded within a few seconds and without the holder relinquishing possession of his/her payment card.

Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

6.1.4.3 Consumer credit
The UBI Banca Group provides consumer credit through its subsidiary B@nca 24-7, with (i) mortgage loans,
(ii) personal and special purpose loans, (iii) issuing credit cards and (iv) providing salary backed loans and
“deduction of loan repayment from salary” products.
B@nca 24-7 was established in 2001 to operate mainly as an intermediary for Internet banking services
(online trading and current accounts).
At the end of 2002, the mission of B@nca 24-7 changed and it became a consumer credit operator, offering a
wider range of products with a particular focus on mortgage loans, personal loans and salary backed loans.
Furthermore, B@nca 24-7 issued credit cards for the BPU Group which has now become the UBI Banca
Group.
B@nca 24-7 operates in the consumer credit sector through distribution agreements with operators
specialised in the sector.
In particular:
 within the mortgage loan area, B@nca 24-7 operates according to an exclusive distribution agreement
with By You S.p.A., in which UBI Banca holds a 10% stake. The distribution agreement, which
expires on 5 October 2011, was amended on 15 February 2011 in order to lift B@nca 24-7’s exclusive
rights for a specified time period, allowing By You S.p.A. to grant mortgage loans to other
intermediaries under certain circumstances.
 With regard to mortgages, the UBI Banca Group has launched an important project that provides for
the transferral of the loan disbursement activities and the management of the whole relationship with
customers to the Network Banks within 2011;
 with regard to salary backed loans, B@nca 24-7 mainly operates according to an exclusive distribution
agreement with Prestitalia, which is 100% owned by B@nca 24-7, and as an agent of other smaller
sales networks. In particular, as part of the reorganisation of its presence in the consumer credit sector,
with special focus on salary backed loans, in September 2010 the UBI Banca Group acquired 100% of
Barberini S.A., a Belgian Company in which UBI Banca held a 33.33% stake, and through this latter
company, Prestitalia S.p.A., of which UBI Banca, through Barberini S.A., held a minority
shareholding of approximately 23%.
 In January 2011, Barberini S.A. sold its equity interest in Prestitalia S.p.A. to B@nca 24-7. This
acquisition by B@nca 24-7 is part of a wider project for the consolidation of consumer credit activities
into B@nca 24-7, which will also allow greater monitoring of the coordination and transparency
required by the Bank of Italy vis à vis customers. During 2010, B@nca 24-7 granted over Euro 1
billion in salary backed loans; 
Section One
99
 in the personal loans segment B@nca 24-7 operates mainly on the basis of an exclusive distribution
agreement with the Group Network Banks for the Group’s own customers, and through an exclusive
agreement with SILF S.p.A., a company of financial agents specialised in personal loans which is
100% Group owned. In 2008, following the merger of BPU with the Banca Lombarda Group, the

6.1.4.5 Factoring
The UBI Banca Group provides factoring services through its subsidiary UBI Factor, Italy’s fourth largest
operator in the factoring sector2
 in terms of outstanding amounts (receivables which have been purchased but
not yet received), with a market share of 6.5%, holding the same position in terms of advances with and
without recourse, with a 7.1% share.
UBI Factor was established as CBI Factor in 1981, upon the initiative of the Istituto Centrale di Banche e
Banchieri. At the end of the 1990s, it was acquired by the Banca Lombarda Group and in 2005 it merged
with Veneta Factoring S.p.A.. CBI Factor became part of the UBI Banca Group on 1 April 2007 and has been
named UBI Factor since 24 September 2008.
UBI Factor offers a complete range of products including all types of factoring (with and without recourse,
definitive factoring without recourse, factoring maturity, factoring maturity for distributors, indirect
factoring, reverse factoring, international factoring, instalment factoring). UBI Factor is also active in the
“confirming” sector, which involves a contract based on which a debtor (usually a company of good standing
with a significant number of suppliers) grants to a factor an irrevocable mandate to pay its suppliers without
assigning receivables, thus replacing the debtor in the management of the debt.
As at 31 December 2010, UBI Factor had 153 employees, net operating income of Euro 53.2 million, and
profit for the year of Euro 18.6 million. In terms of business volumes, the turnover for the year was Euro 7.6
billion.

6.1.4.7 Online banking and trading
UBI Banca Group operates in the online banking and trading sector through IW Bank, a bank specialised in
providing online financial and banking services.
IW Bank has been in business since 1999 and provides specialised banking and financial services to retail
and institutional customers, almost exclusively through the Internet. The offering includes trading of
financial instruments, placement of UCITS, current accounts, issuing of credit and debit cards, electronic
money, insurance, personal mortgages and loans.
Development of the online trading and banking activity by increasing the shareholding in IW Bank
On 27 October 2010, following conclusion of a shareholders’ agreement between UBI Banca and Webstar
S.A. regarding the business integration project of IW Bank operations with those of Twice SIM S.p.A. (see
Section One, Chapter V, Paragraph 5.1.5), UBI Banca and Webstar S.A. announced to the market that the
threshold of 90% of the share capital with voting rights of IW Bank had been exceeded and they did not
intend to restore the float of the IW Bank share. UBI Banca therefore committed to fulfil the obligation of
purchasing the residual ordinary shares prior to the delisting of the stock, including on behalf of Webstar
S.A., on 19 April 2011. With effect from that date, the ordinary shares of IW Bank were delisted from the
MTA.
As at 31 December 2010, IW Bank had 291 employees, net operating income of Euro 8 million, a loss for the
year of Euro 0.4 million, direct deposits of Euro 1.5 billion and indirect deposits of Euro 3 billion.

 the partnership agreement with the Cattolica Assicurazioni Group for the exclusive distribution of life
insurance products through the branches of the Network Banks of the former Banca Lombarda Group
(Banco di Brescia, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca di Valle Camonica, Banco di San Giorgio) was
renewed until 31 December 2020. Within the context of this agreement, UBI Banca sold to the
Cattolica Group a 9.99% stake in the share capital of Lombarda Vita S.p.A., thereby reducing its own
shareholding to 40%.
6.1.5 New products and services
As at the Prospectus Date, the products and services of the Group are those which are described in
Paragraphs 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.1.3, 6.1.4 above.
6.1.6 Risk management
Pursuant to the regulations in force, the UBI Banca Group has put in place a risk management system that
regulates in an integrated manner the guidelines of the System of Internal Controls covering regulatory,
methodological and organisational issues which all group companies must adhere to, in order to allow the
Issuer to exercise the planning and strategic, management and technical – operational control activities in an
efficient and economic way.
The Group companies co-operate to identify the risks they are subject to and to define the relative criteria for
their measurement, management and control.
The main principles ruling the Group’s analysis and risk management, to ensure an increasingly prudent and
efficient allocation of the economic and regulatory capital, are:
- rigorous containment of the financial and credit risks and monitoring of all types of risk;
- application of logics aimed at sustainable value creation when defining the propensity to assume risk
and capital allocation;
- definition of the Group’s propensity to assume risks in regard to specific cases of risk and/or specific
activities by adopting a complete set of policies both at Group and single entity level.
Following is information regarding the risk profiles and the relative management and hedging policies
implemented by the group:
- credit risk;
- market risk: i) interest rate risk; ii) price risk; and iii) foreign exchange risk;
- liquidity risk;
- operating risks.
6.1.6.1 Credit risk
The strategic guidelines, policies and instruments for the assumption and management of credit risk are
defined for the parent company by the Risk Management Area together with the Credit Area and with the
support of the relevant specialised structures. In defining the policies for the management of credit risks,
particular attention is paid to maintaining an adequate risk/yield profile and in assuming risks that are in line 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
102
with the risk propensity defined by the top management and, more generally, with the mission of the UBI
Banca Group.
Credit risk management policies in existence are:
 The policy for credit risks, which indicates the limits and terms under which credit risk may be
assumed, this including counterparty risk (the risk of incurring losses due to the default of the
counterparty to which there exists a credit exposure) concentration risk (the risk deriving from the
existence of significant exposures to individual counterparties (or groups), or from exposures to groups
of counterparties that operate in a specific economic sector or which are located in the same
geographic area);
 Policy governing mortgages granted through intermediaries, which indicates the terms under which
external networks may be used for offering mortgages to non captive customers, so as to limit potential
credit risks, operating risks and reputational risks;
 Policy on the portability, renegotiation, replacement and early extinction of mortgages by the direct
customers of the Network Banks, which provides the Group guidelines for carrying out transactions
involving the portability of assets and liabilities, renegotiation, replacement and early extinction
(whether partial or total) of mortgages, in line with the regulatory framework and in order to ensure
maximum timeliness and reduction of connected administrative issues and costs while providing the
Group with the appropriate processes and instruments with which to monitor the relative risks (credit,
operating and reputational). Similarly, the “Policy on the portability, renegotiation, replacement and
early extinction of mortgages- brokered mortgages”, was drafted;
 Policy risk-adjusted pricing, which defines the process for defining and implementing risk adjusted
pricing to the different products that involve the assumption of credit risk;
 Policy on risk from securitisations, which defines the guidelines that the Group shall follow with
regard to managing risk from securitisation activities. This risk refers to traditional as well as synthetic
securitisations in which the Group acts as the originator and which involve the transfer, even if partial,
of the risks relating to the assets being securitised;
 Residual risk policy, which defines the strategic guidelines relating to the management of residual risk,
which is the risk of incurring losses from unanticipated inefficiency of usual credit risk mitigation
techniques used by the Group.
The units involved in credit operations are organised as follows:
 Centralised control and coordination structures of the Issuer;
 General Managements of the Banks and the subsidiaries which the following report to: Credit
Departments; Peripheral Decision Hubs; Branches; Corporate Business Units (CBUs); Private
Business Units (PBUs).
This organisational model evidences a clear distinction between commercial and credit functions, in addition
to allowing for a strong uniformity between the Issuer’s credit structures and the similar structures of the
Network Banks, ensuring linearity of processes and information flows optimisation. The granting of credit is
also differentiated by customer segment (retail/private, corporate and institutional) and further specialised by
loan status: performing (managed by the Retail, Private and Corporate Credit Units) and default (managed by
the Non performing Loan Unit).
Furthermore, within the banks, the introduction of the decentralised Peripheral Decision Hubs (PDH)
supporting the retail branches and the structures in charge of private customers, ensures effective
coordination and co-operation between the units operating in each specific market. Through the Loans and
Debt Recovery, Risk Control, Strategic Planning and Development, and Parent company and Group Audit
Macro Areas, the parent company monitors the management of the policies, the portfolio, the improvement
of the evaluation systems, the management of problem loans and compliance with regulations. 
Section One
103
In consideration of the specific federal structure of the Group, it was decided to adopt a “focused” model for
the corporate customers that do business with several of the Network Banks, in which:
 a lead bank named the “pivot bank” centralises the decisions regarding credit risk management, the
definition of price levels and the setting up of commercial development policies for shared customers,
avoiding the lowering of the overall profitability of the relationship;
 non-pivot banks do not initiate new relations and/or extend new credit lines.
The structures through which the Banks and Product Companies operate handle credit and commercial
activities, and are also in charge of controlling activities carried out directly or by units under their hierarchy.
In particular, the responsibility for the management and monitoring of performing loans is attributed initially
to the Relationship Managers who handle the daily relationship with customers and are immediately aware of
any signs of difficulty or impairment in credit quality. Secondly, the organisational unit in charge of
monitoring credit risk named “Credit Quality Monitoring Department” controls, supervises and analyses the
performing positions, in analytical as well as aggregate terms, with progressive depth and intensity,
according to the risk rating attributed to the counterparties and the severity of the irregularities recognised.
The structure, which is not involved in the decision-making regarding extension of the credit lines, assesses
and decides (or involves higher decision-making Bodies when the decision exceeds its own competences) the
downgrading in the classification of “performing” counterparties, requesting, when envisaged by the Credit
Regulations, a non binding preliminary opinion to the parent company’s Credit Area through a request by its
own Credit Department. Within the UBI Banca Credit Area, the Credit Quality Service is in charge of
coordinating and defining the guidelines for the monitoring of the loan portfolio, managing the development
of monitoring instruments, controlling credit policies and preparing management reports.
The Risk Management Area is part of the Risk Control Macro Area, where it:
 defines the Group criteria and methodologies for the development of internal rating models, default
probabilities (DP), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in line with regulatory
requirements and best practices;
 produces periodic analyses that illustrate the risk profile of the total loan portfolio and the commercial
sub-portfolios at Group level and for the individual legal entities, in terms of distribution by rating
class, loan deterioration rates and concentration of Largest Customers;
 in co-operation with the Administration and Tax Area, it develops the methodologies for determination
of the generic provisions based on internal ratings for the Network Banks and Centrobanca and loan
deterioration rates for the other Product Companies;
 defines the methodology and calculates the fair value of performing loans of the Network Banks and
Centrobanca;
 defines the policies for assuming and managing credit risks and drafts the relative implementation
regulations and documents listing amount limits.
As at the Prospectus Date, the internal rating system provides for the use of automatic models for private
customers and for smaller sized businesses, automatic models which include a qualitative questionnaire and a
geo-sectoral module for medium to large companies, and mainly a judgemental model for the large
exposures (economic groups with credit lines in excess of Euro 20 million).
The automatic models statistically summarise the valuations regarding the various risk factors, calibrated
according to the counterparty/model type:
- financial and economic factors;
- performance factors (internal and external);
- qualitative factors (competitive positioning, corporate structure, etc); 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
104
- geo-sectoral factors.
The model for the large exposures includes valuation of the economic – financial analysis component with
the structured judgemental component, which investigates profiles such as shareholding structure,
management, sector, business area and financial flexibility, strongly taking into account the elements relating
to the economic group to which the counterparty belongs. As part of the activities relating to the Basel II
project, where the first validation perimeter relates to the Network Banks and Centrobanca only with regard
to the regulatory “corporate” portfolio, a series of activities took place which aim to implement during 2011
a new generation of rating models and estimates of the LGD for this portfolio, also following interaction
with the Supervisory Authority.
The main elements of this new generation of rating models refer to:
 a review of the credit risk segmentation, which defines what model to apply to each counterparty;
 the development of a new quantitative component, which provides for internal models for the analysis
of the financial component, with elimination of the use of a model provided by an external provider;
 development of new integration engines among the different quantitative analysis components;
 development of new qualitative questionnaires;
 a different way of including information relating to the Group the company belongs to within the
automatic rating models;
 a new process for updating the rating which aims to ensure an optimal mix between the need to include
updated information and maintain a contained level of volatility.
Within the Network Banks, the processes generated or directly impacted by the introduction of internal
ratings are:
 identification of the model for the calculation of the counterparty rating;
 assignment of the initial rating;
 assignment of the performance rating: attribution of the rating to all the counterparties based on
operations, risks, qualitative and financial statement information, where available;
 rating override: a request made by the Relationship Manager and the Network Bank central credit
structures to amend a rating calculated by the system;
 monitoring of the rating; verification of the performance rating recalculated periodically after the first
assignment; annual rating verification: updating of data used in the calculation of the rating by the
interested parties (e.g. Relationship Manager).
The operating units involved in the process of granting and renewing loans use internal ratings, which are
essential and indispensable elements of the valuations formulated when investigating and reviewing the
credit lines; the articulation of the delegations is defined by taking account of the customer’s risk profile or
of the transaction as represented by the rating and managed by the Electronic Credit Line Procedure. The
ratings are used by the management reporting system as well as in the information flows made available to
the bank structures involved in the loan process.
The attribution of a rating class other than that calculated by the internal rating system based on the adopted
models takes place through a rating override proposal with diversified presentation, examination and
validation procedures for:
 an upgrading override;
 a downgrading override.
Section One
105
These changes are caused by assessment of information that has not been considered in the rating model, has
not been adequately weighted by the model or which will have a future influence that must be taken into
account.
In light of the recent proposals for amendment of the prudential regulations (Basel III) which will be
gradually introduced from 2013 and the financial crisis which has unfolded its effects over the last two years,
the macro-planning of the Basel III project aims to apply the first calculation of the minimum capital
requirement using the AIRB approach for credit risk by the end of 2012.
The Group uses typical risk mitigation techniques for banking by acquiring from the counterparty, for some
types of credit lines, collateral in the form of real estate, financial guarantees and personal guarantees.
The main types of collateral accepted by the Group are:
 mortgages;
 pledges.
For mortgage guarantees, there is a distinction between credito fondiario1
 loans and ordinary mortgage loans
depending on the amount of the loan which, in the former case, must fall within set limits established with
regard to the value or the costs of the guarantee assets.
Pledges are the second macro-category of collateral and within the Group there are different types of pledges
that can be used depending on the instrument that is pledged.
A pledge on the value of a group of financial instruments is established by using defined measurement
criteria and specific deviations which reflect the variability of the value of the security being pledged. For
financial instruments expressed in a foreign currency, the deviation for the foreign exchange fluctuations
must be added to the volatility of the security.
In the case of pledges on rights deriving from insurance policies, only life insurance policies with regulations
that expressly allow pledging in favour of the the Bank under specific conditions are allowed (e.g., upon
expiration of the deadline for exercising the redemption option, the policies that provide for payment only in
the case of death must be excluded, etc...). Appropriate measurement criteria and deviations are also defined
for insurance policies.
To ensure the presence of the general and specific requirements for the recognition for supervisory purposes
of collateral, included among the credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques pursuant to the Bank of Italy
Circular no. 263 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent amendments, the Group has:
 redefined the credit procedures relating to the collection and management of guarantees;
 recovered for existing mortgage guarantees all information necessary to ensure their eligibility,
pursuant to the provisions of Basel II in terms of specific requirements.
The classification of portfolios in default takes place according to regulations as follows:
 past due loans;
 restructured loans;
 impaired loans;
 non-performing loans.

1 Credito fondiario is defined by article 38 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB) as a medium and long term first lien mortgage secured on
real estate, with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80%. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
106
The problem loans are managed according to the relative level of risk: management of past due, impaired
and restructured loans is carried out by the organisational structures in charge of managing problem loans for
the Banks; management of non performing loans has been centralised in the Non-performing Loans Service
within the Loans and Debt Recovery Macro Area of the parent company.
The adequacy of the value adjustments is measured analytically, for each individual position, to ensure
adequate levels of coverage for expected losses. Analysis of problem loans is continually carried out by the
individual operating units which manage the risks and by the parent company. Resolution of the delinquent
status by the counterparties is a determining factor for the positions to return to “performing”; this event is
essentially concentrated in past due and impaired loans.
6.1.6.2 Market risk
In general, the management of the Group’s financial risks is centralised with the Issuer through the Finance
Macro Area.
The guidelines for assumption and monitoring of financial risks within the UBI Banca Group are listed
within the UBI Banca Group financial risks policy, the relative implementing Regulation and the document
listing the operating limits, with particular reference to market risks on trading portfolios and interest rate,
foreign exchange and liquidity risks on the banking portfolio.
Trading portfolio
In the trading book, monitoring of the coherence of the risk profile of the Group’s portfolios compared to the
rate/yield objectives is based on a system of limits using a combination of various indicators.
In particular, for each Group portfolio the following are defined:
– Mission;
– Maximum loss limit;
– VaR limit;
– Types of financial instruments allowed;
– Any composition limits.
Compliance with the limits assigned to each portfolio is verified on a daily basis.
For measurement of the bank’s exposure to interest rate, exchange, equity, credit spread, commodities and
volatility risk, the measure identified is the value at risk. This is a statistic measure which enables an
estimation of the loss that could occur in the event of adverse movements in the risk factors.
The UBI Banca Group VaR is measured with a historical simulation methodology, using a confidence
interval of 99% and the holding period of one day. This value is presented in terms of limits, in line with the
time required for the potential disinvestment of the portfolios. The VaR expresses the daily loss “threshold”
which, based on probability assumptions, could be exceeded only in 1% of the cases.
In addition to the risk indications deriving from the usage of the VaR, the Group also has a stress test
programme with which to identify the events or factors that could significantly affect a position. The stress
tests are of a quantitative as well as a qualitative nature and take account of the market risk as well as the
liquidity effects generated by market turbulence; they are based both on theoretical shocks created ad hoc as
well as on market shocks observed in a predefined historical period.
Currently the provisional capacity of the risk measurement model adopted is verified through a daily back
testing analysis which uses an actual profit and loss calculated by the Issuer’s front office system. 
Section One
107
Banking portfolio
Interest rate risk
The interest rate risk consists of changes in interest rates that reflect on:
 the net interest income and, consequently, the profits of the bank (cash flow risk);
 the current net value of the assets and liabilities, which impact on the current value of the future cash
flows (fair value risk).
The control and management of the structural interest rate risk – from fair value and from cash flows – is
centralised with the parent company, through the definition of a system of limits/warning thresholds based on
indices assessed in the event of a parallel shock increasing the interest curve by +100 bps; in particular,
limits and/early warnings are established in terms of variation in the net interest income and sensitivity.
At the individual level and referring only to the sensitivity of the economic value, a guideline which
essentially balances the exposure to interest rate risk has been established, except for specific attributions of
early warning thresholds to individual Group Companies/Banks.
The exposure to interest rate risk is measured through gap analysis and sensitivity analysis models and
models assessing the impact on the net interest income on all financial instruments, assets and liabilities
which are not included in the trading portfolio pursuant to supervisory regulations.
The sensitivity calculation of the economic value refers only to positions with contractual expiry and is
carried out by including the impacts arising from the early extinguishment and renegotiation of mortgages
and loans. The analysis of the impact on the net interest income is developed over a time horizon of 12
months, taking into consideration both the change in the net interest income on the sight positions and on the
positions with contractual expiry.
The measurement, monitoring and reporting of the interest rate risk exposures is carried out each month at
consolidated level and at individual level by the parent company’s Risk Management Area. Based on the
periodical information produced, the parent company’s Finance Macro Area sets up the appropriate actions to
avoid exceeding the limits and any early warning thresholds. In particular, in order to reduce exposure to
adverse changes in fair value due to interest rate risk, the Group sets up specific and generic hedges only
through derivative financial instruments. The derivative contracts used are of the interest rate swap or cap
type.
Verification of the effectiveness of the hedge is carried out through prospective testing at the time of
activation of the hedge, run by the Finance Macro Area, followed by a retrospective testing, usually at the
end of each month, carried out by the Risk Management Area.
Exchange rate risk
The exchange rate risk is the risk of incurring a loss due to adverse changes in foreign currency rates on all
the positions held by the Group, regardless of the portfolio in which they are included.
The exchange rate risk is determined on the basis of existing mismatching between assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies (spot and forward), for each out currency (other than the Euro).
In the Group, the exchange risk refers to banking portfolio exposures originating from the Network Banks
and/or the Product Companies and deriving from their commercial operations, and to positions relating to
foreign currency trading activities.
The Group treasury operates on foreign exchange markets using instruments such as forwards, forex swaps,
domestic currency swaps and currency options, to optimise the risk profile of the Group’s foreign exchange
positions. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
108
The exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is defined starting from the net position in foreign exchange,
through a methodology that reflects the supervisory regulations. The equity investments and property,
equipment and investment property are not included in the determination of the net position in foreign
exchange.
The foreign exchange risk deriving from banking portfolio exposures is mitigated through systematic
balancing, using funding/investment transactions in the same currency as that of the original transaction. This
risk containment activity is also carried out by the Product Companies for their own banking book positions.
The residual exposures and the trading portfolio are specifically fully covered by Forex spot positions.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined within the UBI Banca Group as the risk of being unable to fulfil commitments to
pay, which may be caused by the inability to obtain funds or by obtaining them at costs that are higher than
market costs (funding liquidity risk) or by disinvestment limitations (market liquidity risk), resulting in
capital losses.
Structural liquidity risk is the risk of mismatching asset and liability items maturities.
The main objective of the liquidity risk management system is to allow the Group to fulfil its payment
obligations and to collect additional funds on the market, thereby minimising the costs without
compromising potential future profits.
The Group’s liquidity is managed internally in respect of the following general principles:
 adoption of a centralised management of the Group’s treasury;
 diversification of the funding sources and warning thresholds referred to exposure to institutional
counterparties;
 protection of the Group’s capital in liquidity crisis situations;
 appropriate financial balance between assets and liabilities;
 an appropriate level of assets eligible for refinancing and/or which can be liquidated, able to ensure
liquidity requirements coverage also under conditions of stress.
The control and management of the liquidity risk are carried out centrally by the parent company through the
definition of rules aimed at pursuing and maintaining a sufficient level of diversification of the funding
sources and adequate structural balance of deposits and lending in the Network Banks and the Product
Companies, through coordinated and efficient deposit and lending policies and a limits and early warnings
system aimed at monitoring the evolution of the Group’s overall liquidity needs and the relative funding
sources, verifying their consistency and sustainability over time.
The liquidity management model adopted by the Group also aims to make uniform, for all Group companies,
both the intervention procedure and the identification criteria of the economic conditions, with potential prior
identification of specific exceptions.
The contingency funding plan or CFP is the emergency plan for liquidity management and part of the
implementing regulation of UBI Banca Group Financial Risk policy. It aims to protect the bank’s capital in
situations of liquidity draining, by setting up crisis management strategies.
Monitoring the liquidity risk is the responsibility of:
 the Finance Macro Area (first level control) which monitors liquidity on a daily basis and manages risk
within set limits;
 the Risk Management Area (second level control) which carries out periodic verifications of
compliance with the limits.
Section One
109
The liquidity risk is handled by measuring, monitoring and managing the liquidity requirements through a
model that analyses the net liquidity balance at consolidated level over a period of 30 days, and runs stress
tests that assess the Group’s capacity to handle crisis scenarios characterised by an increasing level of
severity. In particular, the net liquidity balance which represents the Group’s capacity to fulfil its own
commitments over a specific time period, is measured both on a going concern basis and in stress scenarios.
The objectives of the stress tests are to assess the vulnerability of the Group to exceptional but plausible
events; this makes it possible to better assess the exposure to liquidity risk, the relative mitigation and control
systems and the survival period in the event of adverse scenarios.
Pursuant to the Supervisory Provisions, the liquidity risk management system adopted by the Group also
provides for monitoring of funding sources at consolidated as well as individual level, using a system of
indices. Early warning thresholds and limits are associated with these indices to verify sustainability over
time in relation to the current and expected liquidity requirements of the Group as well as consistency with
the level of dependence on institutional markets that is considered acceptable by the Group.
Monitoring of the structural balance is also pursued by using models that assess the degree of stability of the
liabilities and the degree of liquidity of the assets, so as to contain the risk associated with the transformation
of the maturities to a tolerance threshold considered acceptable by the Group.
The model adopted by the Group for monitoring structural balance which replaces the methodological
system of the rules for transformation of maturities, aims to reflect the general guidelines being defined as
part of the prudential regulation review process in regard to liquidity risk, with specific reference to medium
and long-term indices.
The assessment of the degree of stability of the liabilities and the degree to which assets can be liquidated is
based mainly on residual life criteria and on the classification of the counterparties which contribute to
defining the weighting of the asset and liability items.
The UBI Banca Group also participates in ad hoc quantitative simulation analyses carried out by the
Supervisory Authority, which defines the stress test scenarios to be applied to the deposit and loan items.
6.1.6.3 Operating risks
Organisational model, management and reporting system
Operational risk is the risk of losses resulting from the inadequacy or malfunctioning of procedures, human
resources and internal systems, or from external events. Losses from fraud, human error, interruptions to
operations, system unavailability, contract defaults and natural disasters all fall under this risk. The definition
includes the legal risk of losses deriving from violations of laws or regulations, contractual or extra
contractual liability or other disputes, but does not include reputational or strategic risk. The risk of
nonconformity (or compliance risk), which is the risk of incurring legal or administrative sanctions or
significant financial losses as a result of statutory provisions or self governance, is also included.
In light of the regulations defined with publication of Circular no. 263 of 27 December 2006 issued by the
Bank of Italy, the UBI Banca Group adopts a standardised method (TSA) used in combination with a Basic
method (BIA) to calculate the required capital for operational risk and has applied for authorisation by the
Supervisory Authority to use an advanced measurement approach model – AMA, which is currently used for
management purposes only, expected by the end of 2011.
The organisational model to manage operational risk is based on a combination of centralised and
decentralised components In this area, the parent company carries out the management, coordination and
control of the business functions on the one hand by supporting the activity of the Network Banks and the
Product Companies in their core business and on the other by providing centralised support services to the
business directly or through subsidiaries. The centralised responsibilities of the parent company are handled
through:
 The Operational Risk Committee: this is the body which manages, governs and monitors the overall
operational risk management process;
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
110
 Operational Risk Department: as the structure in charge of the overall operational risk management
system, it is the unit which designs, develops and maintains the corporate methodology for recognition,
measurement, monitoring and verification of the efficiency of the operational risk mitigation measures
and the connected reporting systems. It is also responsible for managing, coordinating and controlling
the overall management system at Group level;
 Methodologies and Models Department: this is the unit in charge of calculating the capital
requirement for the legal entities intending to adopt advanced methodologies according to the model
validated by the Models and Processes Validation Department and by other entities and corporate and
non-corporate bodies, as in charge from time to time;
 Models and Processes Validation Department: this department is independent of entities or units
involved in the development of risk management and measurement systems; it is in charge of
providing ongoing assessment of the quality of the operational risk management system and its
compliance with regulatory provisions, corporate operational requirements and changes in the
reference market. This activity includes verification of the reliability of the capital requirement
calculation and assessment of the usage of the measurement system within the decision-making
processes and the management of operational risk (use test);
 Risk Policies Department: this unit is in charge of preparing and reviewing the UBI Banca Group
Operational Risk Policy. It is also involved in evaluating and taking out insurance coverage for
mitigation of operational risk.
For the individual legal entities of the Group, the organisational model contains four responsibility levels:
 Operational Risks Contact (ORC): is the person within a legal entity (parent company/Network
Banks/Product Companies”) who is in charge of the implementation of the overall framework for the
management of operational risk as defined by the Group policy and the relative implementation
regulation;
 Local Operational Risk Support (LORS): assists the ORC in carrying out the overall process of
operational risk management for the entity in question. For this same entity, this is also the person
supporting and coordinating the Risk Champion and Risk Owner within the Operational Risk
Management System;
 Risk Champion (RC): provides operational supervision of the operational risk management process
(LDC – loss data collection and SRA – self risk assessment) for overall validation in relation to the
specific business area, by coordinating and supporting the relative Risk Owner. Assists in the
monitoring of risks and participates in defining and implementing the mitigation strategy;
 Risk Owner (RO): the individual in charge of recognising and notifying LDC events and/or events
which potentially lead to operational risk factors (SRA) which arise from daily operations. Participates
in implementing correctional interventions and improvements as communicated by upper levels which
aim to reduce the level of exposure to risk.
The Group’s Operational Risk Management System is composed of:
 a decentralised loss data collection process aimed at recognising in an integrated and systematic way
the damaging events which occurred and resulted in an actual loss, a near miss or a profitable event;
 a structured mapping and assessment process of the risk scenarios and factors within an operational
context and the system of significant internal controls (risk assessment) within the Group’s business
areas, supported by information technology for integrated management, with the intent of providing a
self-diagnosis of the potential exposure to risk of future losses, the efficiency of the control system and
the mitigation measures in existence;
Section One
111
 a database of the operational losses incurred by the Italian System starting from 2003. The Group
participates in the Osservatorio DIPO initiative launched by the ABI (Italian Banking Association) on
operational risk for the exchange of system loss data since the date of its establishment;
 a system for measuring the economic and regulatory capital, for the determination of the capital
absorption of operational risk by business unit using the AMA and standardised method.
A reporting system which provides the necessary information for correct management, measurement and
mitigation of significant risks assumed by the Group has been realised to support the monitoring activity.
This system has the same responsibility structure as the organisational model, so as to support the multiple
information requirements of the Group’s federal model, in order to ensure standardisation of information and
allow for regular verification of operational risks assumed prior to definition of strategies and management
objectives, consistent with the risk standards that are considered as acceptable.
The UBI Banca Group has concluded appropriate insurance policies to cover the major transferable
operational risks, with account taken of the requirements set forth in the Prudential Supervisory Provisions
(Bank of Italy Circular 263/2006). The insurance policies were concluded by UBI Banca in its own name and
on behalf of the Network Banks and Product Companies of the Group.

With reference to the dynamics observed in recent periods, direct deposits totalled Euro 104.8 billion as at 31
March 2011, a decrease of Euro 2.5 billion in the “Due to customers” aggregate which was only partially
offset by a modest increase in the securities component (+ 0.6 billion).
In detail, all components of the “Due to customers” aggregate were down in the first quarter of 2011.
Specifically, within the financing item, repurchase agreements with the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia
(Central Counterparty Clearing House) were down by Euro 1.1 billion as a result of lower investments in
Italian government securities. Similarly, current accounts and term deposits were down by a total of about
Euro 1 billion.
Securities issued totalled Euro 48.7 billion, an increase of Euro 0.6 billion over the year-end balance due to
the gradual increase in bonds.
As at 31 December 2010, direct funding from customers stood at Euro 106.8 billion: a year-on-year increase
of Euro 9.5 billion, which includes Euro 5.8 billion in amounts due to customers and Euro 3.7 billion in
securities issued.
The evolution of amounts due to customers over the twelve month period was driven by the significant
growth of repurchase agreements (Euro +5.9 billion) due to the increase in repo transactions with the Cassa
di Compensazione e Garanzia (Central Counterparty Clearing House) (Euro +5.7 billion) – used to fund the
position in Italian government bonds in the context of the income support operation approved in May – and a
recovery of repurchase agreements with customers (Euro +0.2 billion).
Net of transactions with the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, amounts due to customers are largely in
line with the previous financial year (+ 0.2%).
Current accounts suffered a fall-back (Euro -0.8 billion) which was mostly concentrated in the first quarter of
2010, despite a partial recovery that took place in the second half of the year, coinciding with the launch of a
series of commercial initiatives concerning direct funding.
With regard to term deposits, their growth (Euro +0.4 billion) is attributable to UBI International (Euro +0.5
billion) – as a result of the transfer of the operations of the Luxembourg branch of Banco di Brescia – and
UBI Banca (Euro +0.1 billion) in relation to the new transactions with Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia
within the “New MIC”.
Net of the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia transactions, the Group’s direct funding from customers
increased by Euro 3.7 billion (+ 4%) year-on-year.
Management figures for the average volumes of direct funding (network banks and UBI Private Investment
aggregate) show that, as at December 2010, 79.5% of direct funding from customers came from the retail
market (76.8% as at December 2009), 11% from the private banking market (13.8% in 2009) and 9.5% from
the corporate market (9.4% in 2009).
In terms of annual trends, the same figures show changes of +0.1% for the retail market, although there are
differences within this market (-1% for private customers, compared with +7.6% for the small businesses
segment), -2.7% for the corporate market and -22.8% for the private market (the latter following a partial
shift towards forms of indirect funding).
As at 31 December 2009, direct funding amounted to Euro 97.2 billion, slightly lower than the Euro 97.6
billion recorded in late 2008. The annual comparison showed growth in the “Securities issued” component as
a result of the newly issued covered bonds, intended to provide medium/long term funding in view of
balancing assets and liabilities, while there was a fall in the amounts “Due to customers” (Euro -1.3 billion),
mainly due to the contraction of repurchase agreement transactions (Euro -5.3 billion). Considered to be no
longer convenient because of the economic situation that followed the financial market crisis of 2008, these
transactions were gradually replaced in 2009 by a preference among customers for investing their cash in
“current accounts and demand deposits” (Euro +4.5 billion) or in other forms of indirect funding.

123
In the context of bond funding among institutional customers, mention should be made, with reference to
2009, of the placement of the first two issues of Covered Bonds pursuant to Article 7-bis of Law 130/99,
each with a nominal value of Euro 1 billion.
The UBI Banca listed bonds issuing programme launched in late 2008 continued in respect of the customers
of network banks. Such placements partially replaced the issuing by network banks of their own bonds, the
stock of which therefore fell compared to 2008 (Euro -0.8 billion).

The bond component prevails among the funding components relating to securities issued.
In 2010, this aggregate benefited from an increase in the institutional component.
Medium to long-term institutional issues took place amounting to Euro 3.5 billion (including Euro 1.75
billion in Covered Bonds and Euro 1.7 billion in EMTN bonds), compared to Euro 1.7 billion in EMTN
maturing bonds.
With regard to short-term funding, Euro Commercial Papers and French certificates of deposits amounted to
Euro 3.4 billion at the end of 2010, compared to Euro 2.4 billion at the end of 2009.
Funding through retail bonds also rose from Euro 25.9 billion at the end of 2009 to Euro 27.6 billion at the
end of 2010.
Faced with total bond maturities of Euro 11.4 billion in 2011, the Group has already issued securities for
Euro 4.5 billion on both the retail and institutional market.
Note that after the closing date of 31 March 2011, a senior bond issue was carried out by UBI Banca under
an EMTN programme amounting to Euro 1 billion.

NET INTERBANK POSITION (2,822,509) (2,263,625) (2,046,170) (927,218)
As at 31 March 2011, the Group’s net interbank position is negative by Euro 2.8 billion, a slight increase
compared to the end of the year (+Euro 0.5 billion).
In the final quarter of 2011, growth in loans to banks and in amounts due to banks can be observed, relating
to the purchase of eligible securities, pending the process of assigning the second rating to certain internal
securitisations, although deposits show a greater degree of variability.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group’s net interbank was negative by Euro 2.3 billion, essentially unchanged
compared to 31 December 2009.
In all the periods analysed, however, the Group’s net interbank exposure continues to remain below the early
warning threshold (Euro 6 billion – lowered to Euro 4 billion in 2011) identified by the company’s governing
bodies.
It is in fact important to point out that access to the interbank market is a complementary/residual source of
funding for the Group compared to its other sources of funding on institutional markets.
In the twelve months of 2010, the analysis of the aggregates shows an almost constant level of loans to banks
while the dynamics of funding from banks show a greater degree of variability (the highest level was reached
in June 2010, coinciding with difficulties experienced by the markets for longer term issues, but then fell
back at the end of the year to the same values as at the end of 2009, thanks to the many funding actions
undertaken by the Group and the recovery of international placements).
In detail, as at the end of 2010, funding from banks amounted to Euro 5.4 billion and remained constant
compared to the end of 2009. During the year, however, borrowing from the Central Bank increased. This
was partly justified by tensions in the liquidity markets and has triggered a shift towards more stable funding
as a result of the full-allotment effect.
Assets eligible for refinancing with the Central Bank amounted to Euro 9.1 billion as at 31 December 2010
(Euro 9.9 billion as at the end of 2009). The change from the previous year is mainly due to the amortisation
of internal securitisations and to maturities among portfolio securities.
Internal securitisation activities
Over the years, the Group has underwritten a number of internal securitisation transactions in order to
improve liquidity risk management and increase assets eligible for refinancing with the Bank of Italy and/or
with the European Central Bank.

The ratio of direct funding to loans to customers stood at 104.9% as at 31 December 2010, an increase
compared to December 2009 (99.2%); as at 31 March 2011, this ratio was 102.07%.
For information on the funding structure, please refer to Paragraph 10.1 above.
10.4 Limitations to the use of the Group’s financial resources
As at the Prospectus Date, there are no forms of limitations to the use of the Group’s cash.
10.5 Expected sources of funding
Self-financing, the funding instruments traditionally used by the Group and described in this Chapter,
together with the financial resources that will be obtained by future issues of hybrid capitalisation
instruments and subordinated liabilities, are the main sources of funding for the Group’s future business.
We should however mention that the Group issued a Convertible Bond – with a total nominal value of Euro
639,145,872 – on 10 July 2009, which cannot be considered to be one of the Group’s traditional sources of
funding but which was issued with the aim of providing – over the medium term – a possible strengthening
of capital to support lending to companies in the areas in which the Group operates.
This Convertible Bond is a source of funding which, in the medium term and in any case after 18 months
from issue (i.e., from January 2011), may be converted, by exercising the conversion option, if required by
the Group, into a capital strengthening instrument (with a potential positive impact on Core Tier I of about 70
b.p.).
The conversion mechanism envisaged by the Convertible Bond Regulations gives maximum flexibility to the
Issuer, while protecting the investor, who will always be guaranteed a refund, in cash and/or shares, of the
nominal value of the bonds, even if the stock price were to fall below the face value of the bond (plus a
premium of 10% of the nominal value in the event of early redemption by the Issuer).
In the absence of any specific commitments by the Group regarding investments and fixed assets (see
Section One, Chapter V, Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of the Prospectus), there are no other means of funding
other than those described in the above paragraphs.

CHAPTER XI – RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES
In view of the industry in which the Issuer operates, research and development activities are not considered
significant for the purposes of the Prospectus.

CHAPTER XII – INFORMATION ON EXPECTED TRENDS
12.1 Most significant trends
There is some early evidence in 2011 confirming the continuation of the growth phase of the world economy,
leading to the assumption that the recovery will gather strength this year. However, the macroeconomic
effects of the earthquake in Japan, the various political and social conflicts in North Africa and the Middle
East, the oil crisis that has led to an increase in oil prices and their greater volatility, as well as less
accommodating monetary conditions adopted by several central banks aiming to fight inflationary pressures,
could have an impact on the economy’s growth rates and increase the volatility of financial and market data.
In 2010, Italian GDP was up 1.2% in real terms and this figure should also be confirmed for 2011, during
which, inter alia, increased employment stability will be observed. With regard to the Euro area, the recent
hikes in inflation have led the European Central Bank to increase official ECB rates. This will have the effect
of further increasing Euribor rates and short and medium-term IRS.
In this macroeconomic context, the Italian banking sector showed signs of recovery in an environment of
low, but rising, interest rates. In particular, bank rates and margins should continue to progressively increase,
although still at contained levels also in 2011. Upward adjustment of lending and deposit rates is expected
with the normalisation of liquidity and the gradual recovery of monetary rates, gaining impetus with the
increase in the official ECB rates.
The signs of recovery of the economy will sustain the growth of lending both relating to business and
personal home loans, even if growth for this latter type of lending will be lower following the anticipated
increase in interest rates. Altogether, the growth in lending should be moderate, given the low anticipated
economic growth rate, the attention paid to liquidity, funding and capital management, which is also affected
by the progressive introduction of restrictive prudent regulations.
As regards funding, direct deposits will represent a key factor for banks especially in consideration of the
tension in recent years in the banking sector, with particular reference to the dynamic of spreads and the
resulting cost of funding. Italian banks should be able to benefit from the good level of the retail savings rate,
in spite of the systemic downturn seen in comparison with the past. In actual fact, the gradual increase of the
cost of holding cash in accounts should favour investment in securities by savers.
Lastly, assets under management, although affected by some uncertainty deriving from the dynamic of the
financial markets, should benefit from the normalisation of the markets and the return of the interest of
investors in investments featuring a greater risk-return ratio.
As regards the UBI Banca Group, the Industrial Plan envisages a trend aimed at guaranteeing sustainable
development in the medium-and long-term and the achievement of a satisfactory level of profitability,
primarily via the containment of operating costs, improving credit quality and reinforcing liquidity and
capital. From 2011, it is possible to foresee, on the basis of information available as at the Prospectus Date, a
recovery in net interest income despite increasing competitive pressures in the area of deposits, and an
overall increase in operating income, thanks to the repricing actions on the commission components
currently being gradually implemented.
In conclusion, considering the above, the UBI Banca Group expects for 2011 an improvement in the
profitability of ordinary activities compared to 2010, based also on the first quarter results.
12.2 Trends, uncertainties, requests, undertakings or events that are reasonably likely to have a
significant impact on the Issuer’s prospects for at least the current financial year
As at the Prospectus Date, except as described in Section One, Chapter IV, and as described in the previous
Paragraph 12.1, the Issuer is not aware of any trends, uncertainties, requests, undertakings or events that are
reasonably likely to have a significant impact on the Issuer’s prospects for at least the current financial year.

CHAPTER XIII – PROFIT PROJECTIONS OR ESTIMATES
13.1 The main assumptions on which the Issuer based its consolidated data projections
13.1.1 Introduction
On 13 May 2011, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of the Issuer approved the Group’s
Industrial Plan containing the strategic guidelines and the operating, financial and capital objectives for the
2011-2015 period (the “Industrial Plan”).
On 16 May 2011, the Industrial Plan was presented to the financial community. The document used for the
presentation, “2011-2013/2015 Industrial Plan – Quality Matters”, is available to the public on the website
of the Issuer at www.ubibanca.it.
The main assumptions upon which the Issuer has based the consolidated data projections, set out in this
Paragraph, are a fraction of those included in the Industrial Plan presented to the financial community.
The Industrial Plan contains projections of the performance of specific sectors in which the Group operates,
the Group’s results expected at the end of the time span covered by the Industrial Plan, and the effects of the
share capital increase covered by this prospectus.
The Industrial Plan was prepared with the direct involvement of the management of the Issuer and of the
individual Group companies. It was prepared based upon a shared mission and specific guidelines set by the
Issuer for each segment in which the Group operates and in continuity with other initiatives already
undertaken by the Group in previous years.
The development of the Industrial Plan is based on estimates and assumptions related to the occurrence of
future events (including the subscription in full of the share capital increase) and of management actions. The
main assumptions upon which the Industrial Plan is based include, inter alia:
(i) general assumptions relating to future events depending on variables which are beyond the
management’s control (e.g. macroeconomic scenario, the performance of financial markets etc.)
reported in paragraph 13.1.3;
(ii) discretionary assumptions connected with specific management and organisational actions which the
management has initiated or plans to initiate during the time span of the Industrial Plan, reported in
paragraph 13.1.4; and
(iii) effects expected by the management as a result of these management and organizational actions.
Changes in the main income statement and statement of financial position items have been determined using
estimates of volumes, interest rates and spreads applied to customers made by the UBI Banca Group
including on the basis of the estimated change in the economic situation and the banking sector made by
leading research institutes, and including the effects of the various initiatives planned by the management.
Furthermore, the estimates of the regulatory ratios’ expected trend, specified below, do not include the 100%
conversion of the Convertible Bond in accordance with the conditions laid down for 2013.
The projections of the Group’s trends and expected performance are based upon assumptions about future
events which are subject to uncertainties (such as those that characterise the expected macroeconomic
scenario, the performance of financial markets and the results of management actions), which, if they fail to
occur, could lead to deviations, including significant, compared to the projections.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic scenario and the outcome of the measures and
actions taken by the management, investors are cautioned not to refer exclusively to the Industrial Plan in
taking their investment decisions.
The starting point of the Industrial Plan’s projections is the consistency of management data with the Group’s
accounting records as at 31 December 2010. Furthermore, for the purposes of the Industrial Plan the
consolidation scope is the same as the one at 31 December 2010. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
130
The projections covering the Industrial Plan’s period were prepared using as a reference the accounting
principles used by UBI Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December
2010.
13.1.2 Industrial Plan guidelines
In the current market, the banking offer shows services and products that are easily replicated, with
increasing regulatory constraints typical of a sector characterised by a structural maturity. This context makes
the quest for quality’s distinctiveness inevitable.
The guidelines on which the strategic development of the Industrial Plan are based upon essentially consist
of an enhancement of the service’s quality already received by the customers, a high quality personnel,
operational efficiency, a high asset quality and the strengthening of a sound structural balance.
The developments designed to maximize quality in all its various forms, are summarised below:
 optimisation of the capital structure;
 structural strengthening;
 innovation of the distribution model;
 redefining the role of the product companies in the perspective of:
o specialisation and complementarity with the Network Banks’ offer;
o reorientation of external networks on the acquisition of new customers to be directed to the
network banks to increase retention and the cross-selling rate;
o optimisation of their capital and financial structure;
 maintaining the current level of costs in spite of significant investments;
 consolidation of the low risk profile;
 strengthening the already solid dividend policy.
The Industrial Plan’s objectives defined on the basis of the guidelines specified above include:
 a quick return to profitability in line with the cost of capital;
 maintaining strong financial position;
 strengthening the structural balance;
 improving Customer Satisfaction;
 strengthening the dissemination of the Group’s identity among employees;
 the consolidation of the perception by customers, personnel, investors and local communities that UBI
Banca = “a High Quality Bank”.
The Industrial Plan includes: (i) a growth in assets consistent with growth in liabilities; (ii) growth with low
risk profiles; (iii) a focus on returns on assets; (iv) containment of cost items by maximising economies of
scales; and (v) confirmation of the historical high level of credit quality. 
Section One
131
13.1.3 Key general assumptions underlying the preparation of the projections
Macroeconomic and financial scenario
At the base of the Industrial Plan is an analysis of the economic scenario of reference developed by UBI
Banca Group by elaborating the estimates of the financial trends and of the banking sector prepared by
qualified centres of economic research (ABI, the Italian Banking Association, and Prometeia), appropriately
adapted by management to the context and dynamics in which the Group operates.
The main assumptions are summarised below:
 Consolidation of the economic recovery and increased pressures on prices;
 Gross domestic product trend: moderate GDP growth is expected during 2013 (1.3%) and during
2015 (1.3%);
 Changes in the inflation rate: in the coming months, inflation in the Eurozone is expected to grow,
while in the medium term the harmonised index will return to levels consistent with the ECB’s
objectives. However, this scenario is subject to increases resulting from the commodities prices which
could lead to changes in the expectations of inflation in medium-to-long term, and furthermore could
cause the transfer of inflation from costs to wages (second round effects). In particular, the expected
inflation in the Euro Zone for the 2011-2015 period is 2.0% for 2013, and 2.0% for 2015;
 Reference rate trends: the operating environment underlying the Industrial Plan is that of a gradual
change in the setting of monetary policies by the ECB, with a gradual increase in the reference rate to
3.25% in 2015 with projection of the 1 Month Euribor (annual average) to 3.35% in 2015.
Analyses of the macroeconomic and financial scenario
The macroeconomic and financial trends described above cannot be controlled by management, which has
identified certain risk factors that could affect the base scenario, and in particular: (i) slower than expected
economic expansion for emerging countries; (ii) further significant deterioration of the geopolitical crises in
North Africa and the Middle East; (iii) high volatility of the foreign exchange markets and more specifically
the risk of weakening of the US dollar higher than expected; (iv) excessive increases in the prices of raw
materials, especially in the Energy industry; (v) a significant increase in tensions and volatility on financial
markets in terms of sovereign debt; (vi) difficulties with the process of fiscal consolidation and the reduction
of leverage in the private sector; and (vii) the dynamics of interest rates.
Trends for aggregates in the national banking system
The main indications of the overall scenario in the Italian banking sector for the three years to come (2011-
2013) are:
 lending: an increase in lending mainly due to the general performance of the economy and a recovery
in the securitisation market;
 direct funding: in the wake of rising rates, banks should have greater leeway to increase yields on
funding, taking into account also the reduced levels of saving planned for the current year and the
more competitive conditions on the different funding markets;
 assets under management: there should be a consolidation of the banking products managed
distribution, supported by the changing patterns of service which are made more in line with the
application of MiFID and controls designed to protect retail customers;
 revenues: net interest income should benefit from the gradual consolidation of the economic recovery,
coupled with rising interest rates and the rise in volumes. A positive trend – thanks to the performance
of trading and the other net revenues – is also expected for gross income. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
132
The regulatory framework
The regulatory framework of reference in which the Group operates is particularly important also in the light
of the expected trend of the Business and the consequences on it, included but not limited to, by the new
Basel III minimum capital adequacy requirements and by the tax legislation. Despite the current uncertainty
regarding the final version of the supervisory rules following the Basel III directives, which will gradually
enter into force starting from 2013 to become fully in force in 2019, the Industrial Plan has been prepared
with the intent to comply with the main minimum capital and liquidity requirements of the new regulations
as they apply to the Group.
These levels of development are the framework around which the economic and financial projections for the
UBI Banca Group were made, with the necessary specifications.
13.1.4 Assumptions that are fully or partially affected by management decisions
13.1.4.1 Main discretionary assumptions
The following sections describe the main assumptions at the base of the preparation of the Industrial Plan.
Please note that the assumptions described below are a part/summary of those included in the Industrial Plan
presented to the financial community. The assumptions below are partially classified as hypothetical
assumptions insofar as they related to future events and management actions which may not necessarily
occur in light of their specific nature.
The Industrial Plan provides for: (i) the evolution of the distribution model which aims to synthesise the best
two distribution models of reference, i.e. the hierarchical and the portfolio, and (ii) a review of the market
segment focused on achieving greater commercial positions on high value segments.
The evolution of the distribution model and of the commercial segmentation as well as specific strategic
initiatives are at the basis of the Group’s revenues evolution.
Distinctive features of the Industrial Plan
A) Network banks
I) Retail Market.
a. More personnel dedicated to customers through a significant reorganisation and
enhancement of the branch network aimed at optimising the management of typical Mass
Market customers achieved through a pool of management in this segment and the
development of a strong inter-distribution channel (physical network, contact centre, internet
and mobile banking) creating a major “growth force” (supplied under the project “Mass
Market Machine”).
b. Systematic business-entrepreneur approach to develop the local markets due to focus on
growth of “high value” segments, (affluent small businesses, SMEs), through an approach
based on customer relationships and advisory services as a distinctive feature (personal
investments and financial management of the businesses).
c. “Be a high quality bank”, or a bank that facilitates access to services, innovative and
transparent through continuous innovation in products and procedures to meet the needs of
customers in a simple, transparent and timely manner, with the goal of increasing customer
satisfaction and loyalty as well as the degree of attractiveness of the UBI Banca brand.
II) Corporate Market.
a. Continuous and systematic support for businesses with a strong focus on those rooted in
local markets, properly balancing lending and funding from the perspective of a sustainable
growth also through the development of dedicated funding products. 
Section One
133
b. From a “lending driven” to a “value driven” model with a focus on products and services
with high added values and creation of specific UBI Corporate Advisory Centres in the
Commercial Divisions of the network banks.
c. The creation of units dedicated to Large Corporate customers “not rooted in local markets”
in the Commercial Departments of the network banks with the goal of increasing the focus
on the management of the segment.
d. A focus on foreign commercial business, developing expertise and services in trade finance,
cash management, and the international network.
III) Private Banking Market.
a. Development of integrated financial advisory services on financial, corporate and property
assets with a focus on “families”.
b. Development of financial advisory services to HNW (2,400) and institutional customers with
the Pro-Active Wealth Advisory (Pro-AWA) service, including growth in business-tobusiness
products and services.
c. The extension of fee-based advisory services offering to all private banking customers an
integrated approach to financial, protection and pension aspects.
d. Development of the IT platform for the mobile service in private banking branches.
B) The main product companies and subsidiaries
 Banca 24/7: will focus its attention on fully managed products (in particular, salary-backed loans
and personal loans to captive customers) and it will completely terminate the provision of all
residential mortgage loans. New residential mortgage loans granted through third networks will
be channelled directly to the network banks, with the goal of maximising the opportunities of
placing other UBI Group’s products and to contain operating costs and overheads. In this respect,
agreements with external distribution networks have recently been renegotiated.
The merger of SILF into Banca 24-7 is planned by the end of 2011, and the merger of Prestitalia
S.p.A. into Banca 24-7 before the end of the first quarter of 2012, with the migration of the latter
onto the Group’s IT computer system, thereby allowing a greater control of the channel and
mitigating potential reputational risks.
 UBI Leasing: is expected to focus on sectors deemed appropriate to pursue a better quality of
the lease portfolio, thereby reducing the cost of credit. A substantial reduction in the company’s
branch network is planned with an increase in the use of the banking channel as the distribution
channel.
An upgrade of the IT system is planned as well as an expansion of risk control units.
 IW Bank: growth of customer base and revenues through the development system of advisory
services characterized by high added value, with the goal of consolidating its leadership in online
trading and also developing its banking sector. For the latter the creation of advisory services to
Top Investors clients also on the territory is also planned as well as the use of different models
based on the value added by the customer.
The Growth of IW Bank also foresees the strengthening of its funding platform allowing
significant levels of direct funding in the Italian market and potentially also on foreign markets
where IW Bank already operates (initiatives on foreign markets are not factored into the
Industrial Plan).
 UBI Factor: A greater commercial development is planned with the Group’s bank customers. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
134
This policy is also accompanied by the pursuit of profitability while maintaining a strong focus
on creditworthiness in the delivery of products to non-captive customers. Further international
development in addition to consolidating the company’s presence in Poland and Turkey.
 Centrobanca: Its range of products and services is expected to complement those offered by the
network banks. In this context, “plain vanilla” industrial lending will be provided directly by the
Group’s Network Banks, while Centrobanca will concentrate on structured debt transactions.
The Industrial Plan provides for continuity in the development of credit-related business, both in
terms of volumes and margins, and the further strengthening of high value added services, in
particular in the M&A, Advisory, and Capital Markets sectors.
 UBI Pramerica: the development of UBI Pramerica is projected on the basis of the assumptions
made on the various markets in charge of the Network Banks and in any case in continuity with
previous years.
C) The 2012-2015 Branch Plan
During the 2009-2011 period, which featured substantial continuity in the numbers of branches
opened, the Group mainly focused on their rationalisation (closures and/or transformations) to
eliminate the overlap in the area.
For the 2012-2015 period substantial stability of the branch network is expected, with the opening of
50 branches in areas of development and a rationalisation of 60 branches (40 closures and 20
transformations) in established local markets. Additionally, 170 “enhancement” interventions will be
carried out across selected branches, with the goal of improving their image and visibility in order to
increase their potential.
D) Operational efficiency and innovative development
Management objectives include continuous technological innovation to support the development
plans and a cost reduction to be carried out by increasing efficiency, streamlining processes of
technological (IT) architectures, and the development of multi-channel services.
In particular, the interventions involve strengthening and accelerating investments in multi-channel
distribution with the goal, inter alia, of freeing up resources for the strengthening of business
initiatives, the development of client-facing activities, the creation of efficient work desks, the
digitalisation of processes and specific action on governance systems.
The Industrial Plan also provides for investment for the transformation of IT infrastructures to further
strengthen leadership in the IT sector and maximise the company’s capacity to serve business.
E) Credit quality
The main actions planned by management are summarised below:
 pro-active management of non-performing loans by strengthening the new IT platform dedicated to
the management of the life cycle of deteriorated loans (from the past-due through to the nonperforming
classes); the revision of the organisational model to refine operating processes, to be
differentiated by exposure, type of loan and segment, and the assignment of positions to account
managers who are allocated a specific recovery budget (currently performed at the level of
organisational units). It is also planned to centralise the management of Centrobanca non-performing
loans at UBI Banca.
 Improving problem loans credit quality by assigning budgets for the management of problem loan
portfolios to each Network Bank at branch level or corporate centre, and activation of an electronic
“problem loan report”, again at branch or corporate centre level to monitor the assigned objectives.
 A new performing loans monitoring model, implementing consistent Group models among the main
Product Companies (in terms of arrears management and pricing of the external collection 
Section One
135
companies). Periodic “Credit quality meetings” with Network Banks and Product Companies to
verify the performance of the portfolio, share management strategies, and develop an integrated
credit database to meet the immediate needs of management and operational reporting requirements.
F) Increased sense of belonging for human resources
The main actions planned by management are summarised below:
 Strengthen the sense of meritocracy by periodic assessment and feedback activities; career path
mentoring; transparent and motivating rewarding mechanisms; differentiated management actions
for key personnel, “Talents” and high potential personnel;
 Train to level of excellence through the provision of 100,000 annual days/person of targeted
coaching and motivational projects; managerial training plans and diversity management;
enhancement of management roles in all areas (commercial and central units) and extension of the
“Value in Networks” project; establishment of a centre of excellence for the Group’s human resource
management to increase awareness and involvement;
 Inform and raise awareness through clear and transparent internal communication, which includes
the development of interactive multimedia tools; sharing of fundamental values and the culture of a
“best practices” within the Group; fully-cooperative trade union relations based on the pursuit of
possible shared solutions.
G) Liquidity management
The Group’s liquidity management provides for an institutional funding having also the goal of creating a
liquidity buffer in compliance with the provisions of Basel III, through the replacement of existing eligible
assets (consisting principally of self-securitisations) mainly with Italian government securities no longer
funded by repurchase agreements with the “Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia” (“CCG”). The ratio of
loans to customers to direct funding from customers (excluding repurchase agreements with CCG) is also
planned to be reduced from 105% to 96%.
H) Capital management
The Industrial Plan incorporates with reference to share capital and capital requirements, the innovations of
Basel III, consistent with the timing and plan of gradual implementation. In particular, the development of
the Group’s equity and capital requirements, on the basis of the estimated capital adequacy ratios, include the
impact of:
 the limits on the computation of non controlling interests;
 the deduction of deferred tax assets and equity investments;
 composition and quality of the capital;
 additional requirements for counterparty risk (credit value adjustment and central counterparties).
With regard to the absorption of capital, the plan also factors in the transition to internal models to determine
capital requirements for operational and credit risks according to the following schedule:
 in 2011, adoption of an advanced model for operational risks;
 in 2012, adoption of internal model for operational risks for the Network Banks and Centrobanca in
the corporate segment;
 in 2013, extension of corporate models to UBI Leasing;
 in 2014, extension of corporate models to UBI Factor; 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
136
 in 2015, extension of internal models to retail exposures.
13.1.4.2 Projections
The Industrial Plan’s targets and projections have been constructed on the basis of certain assumptions of
external scenario and of other assumptions about the effects of specific actions wholly or in part controllable
by the management.
With regard to the Convertible Bonds, the estimates set out below do not include the effects of a 100%
conversion of said bonds in accordance with the relative conditions laid down for 2013.
Given the above assumptions about macro-economic trends, sectors and management actions, which are an
integral part of the hypothetical assumptions underlying the Industrial Plan, the following trends of the main
statement of financial position and income statement items were estimated by assuming full, timely and
effective implementation of the measures envisaged in the Plan itself.
The change in the main statement of financial position and income statement items (projections) described
below is a part of that included in the Industrial Plan presented to the financial community.
Lending and funding
In relation to the main statement of financial position items, the Industrial Plan projections for the 2010 –
2015 period an average annual growth of 3.1% for lending, and an average annual growth of 4.8% for direct
funding (excluding funds raised through the repos with the CCG).
The growth of lending and funding, also due to the evolution of the Commercial and Lending Distribution
Models, is essentially in line with market projections.
Customers
The pursuit of the strategic lines of the Industrial Plan will lead to the execution of commercial initiatives
aimed at strengthening and fully enhancing relationships with customers in order to have a positive effect on
retention of existing customers and new customer relationships.
Prices and profit margins
The Industrial Plan contains projected profitability trends per product applied to the Bank consistently with
market trends.
Within the timescale of the Industrial Plan with reference to the management of money, an increase of markdowns
on funding is foreseen due to the effect of increased interest rates, accompanied by an increase in the
overall mark-up on lending; the combination of these developments will on aggregate determine a
progressive broadening of the range of the expected gap between interest income and expense in the five
years covered by the Industrial Plan.
With regard to net commission income, pricing was forecast as essentially in line with the historical data,
with reference to both the traditional banking services (collection and payment services, commissions on
loans and current accounts etc.) and indirect funding.
Revenues
The actions planned in individual business segments, as already reported in section 13.1.2, will allow an
increase in profits to satisfactory levels over the 2011-2015 period, with an increase in the Group’s operating
profit from Euro 3,496 million in 2010, with a 2010 - 2015 CAGR of +7.4% as a result of the following:
 core revenue (i.e., net interest and net commission income) equal to Euro 2,143 million and Euro
1,185 million in 2010, will grow at a 2010 - 2015 CAGR of +7.9% and +6.2% respectively; 
Section One
137
 other income (dividends, trading and hedging and other income), amounting to Euro 168 million in
2010, will grow at a 2010-2015 CAGR of +8.6%.
Personnel
The Industrial Plan includes retraining of personnel for business and increased operating efficiency, leading
to a net reduction of about 1,000 human resources during the Industrial Plan period, of which 800 in addition
to those already planned for 2011, including over 1,000 newly hired during the Industrial Plan’s timeframe,
in support of the generational change and to allow the underlying management’s operations of professional
growth and coverage of the local markets.
Operating expenses
Actions aimed at recovering efficiency will maintain the amount of operating expenses substantially stable.
Overall, the Industrial Plan envisages a slight increase in operating expenses1
, amounting to Euro 2,431
million in 2010, a 2010-2015 CAGR of 0.4%. In more detail:
 Staff costs amounted to Euro 1,418 million in 2010, growing at a 2010-2015 CAGR of 1.0% due to the
combined effect of reducing the number of resources during the Industrial Plan period, the revisions of
the National Labour Collective Agreement (CCNL), and an increase correlated to a stronger
productivity and profitability expectation pertaining the variable part of remuneration and the expenses
incurred for training and requalification of the personnel;
 Other administrative expenses amounting to Euro 770 million in 2010, down to a 2010-2015 CAGR of
-0.8% as a result of a more centralised management of expenses and the implementation of specific
expenditure rationalisation and optimisation actions/measures;
 Amortisation/depreciation amounted to approximately Euro 243 million in 2010, growing at a CAGR
of +0.1% as the result of planned investments in the Industrial Plan period of approximately Euro 700
million mainly targeted and focusing on developing technology (IT) platforms to support business
(approximately Euro 220 million).
The combined effect of all these actions will result in an improvement in the cost/income ratio (except PPA)
of about 18 percentage points in 2015 (from 66.2% in 2010 to 48.2% in 2015).
Problem loans
Within the Industrial Plan there is a slight reduction in net deteriorated loans: the 2010 – 2015 CAGR
amounts to -1.6%. In particular:
 2010 – 2015 CAGR of non-performing loans amounting to 2.2%;
 2010 – 2015 CAGR of net impaired loans amounting to -2.7%;
 2010 – 2015 CAGR of net past-due loans amounting to -8.8%;
 2010 – 2015 CAGR of net restructured loans amounting to -5.5%.
The ratio of net deteriorated loans to net loans to customers falls from 5.17% in 2010 to 4.10% in 2015.
Net impairment losses on loans to net loans to customers ratio
The 2010-2015 net impairment losses on loans to net loans to customers ratio is expected to decrease as a
result of strategic projects provided for in the Industrial Plan. The impact of net impairment losses on loans is

1
 The projections include an ISTAT (Italian National Statistic Institute) increase of 2% annually. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
138
expected to decrease from 69 bps in 2010 to 40 bps in 2015. Such results are achieved through specific
actions to improve credit quality as well as a more effective monitoring of the performing loans.
Corporate liquidity
The Plan envisages a growth in funding in line with loan growth and the creation of a liquidity buffer in
place of the assets currently eligible for Central Banks. In summary, the plan provides for a Liquidity
Coverage Ratio at a level greater than 1 (considering the own-securitisations as eligible assets in terms of
their amortisation) and a Net Stable Funding Ratio close to 1 until 2013 and then greater than 1.
Equity and return
With regard to strengthening the Group’s equity, in addition to the successful completion of the share capital
increase, we envisage a series of actions designed to generate/optimise the equity from a financial and
regulatory standpoint. In particular, the ratio of risk weighted assets (RWA) to total assets is expected to
improve over the Industrial Plan period, mainly due to the validation of the advanced internal model.
In summary, due to expected RWA trends, and self financing and taking into account the effects of the
introduction of Basel III, by the end of 2015 we expect to achieve a common equity ratio of approximately
8.9%.
In terms of profitability, in 2015 the Group will pursue a targeted net profit of approximately Euro 1.1
billion.
In summary, the main objectives of the Industrial Plan are as follows:
2015 (Euro, in billions) 2010-2015 CAGR
FINANCIAL INDICATORS
Loans to customers 118.5 3.1%
Direct funding (excluding repos with CCG) 123.2 4.8%

14.2 Conflicts of interest of members of the Management Board, members of the Supervisory Board

Section One
167
position held with the Bank, except in connection with transactions submitted to the relevant bodies and
approved pursuant to articles 2391 of the Italian Civil Code and 136 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB).
More specifically, in the event of such conflicts of interest, pursuant to Article 2391 of the Italian Civil Code,
the company representative must disclose his or her interests (personal or on behalf of third parties), in a
specific transaction. The Director must disclose the nature, source and extent of his or her interest.
Additionally, pursuant to Article 136 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB), persons performing
administrative, management and control functions at a bank may not directly or indirectly undertake
obligations with or sell or purchase to/from the bank that they manage, direct or control, without the prior
unanimous decision of the Management Board and the favourable vote of all members of the control body,
without prejudice to their obligations under the Italian Civil Code provisions on directors’ interests and
related party transactions. The same provisions also apply to persons performing administrative, management
and control functions, at a bank or company that is part of a banking group, in respect of the above
mentioned obligations or transactions entered into with the same company or financing operations set up
with other companies or banks in the group. In such cases, the obligation or transaction must be approved, in
the manner provided for in paragraph 1, by the bodies of the contracting company or bank and with the
consent of the parent company.
Furthermore, UBI Banca confirms that it has adopted “Regulations for the discipline of related-party
transactions”. Further information on these can be found in Chapter XVI, Paragraph 16.4. These regulations
establish the exclusive jurisdiction of the Management Board in respect of “more significant” transactions
with related parties that are of significant economic and financial relevance to the Issuer.

CHAPTER XV – REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS
15.1 Remuneration and benefits in favour of the Supervisory Board members, the Management
Board members and Senior Executives for services rendered in any capacity
The shareholders’ meeting establishes the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members, as well as an
additional overall amount for the remuneration of those vested with specific appointments, powers or
functions; this is allocated by the Supervisory Board, having consulted the Remuneration Committee,
establishing the remuneration for the Chairman, the Senior Deputy Chairman, the Deputy Chairmen as well
as the members of the Supervisory Board who are assigned specific offices, powers or functions by the
Corporate By-Laws or by said Supervisory Board, considering participation in the Committees among other
aspects. The Supervisory Board members are also assigned attendance fees for participation in the meetings
of said Board, as well as in those of the commissions and committees established by the Supervisory Board
itself, to the extent established by the shareholders’ meeting.
The shareholders’ meeting held on 24 April 2010 resolved:
- a fixed annual remuneration for the three-year period 2010-2011-2012 for each Supervisory Board
member of Euro 100,000 (one hundred thousand), for a total annual amount of Euro 2,300,000;
- the additional overall amount for the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members vested with
specific offices, powers or functions as Euro 1,500,000 per annum.
The above amounts are inclusive of attendance fees.
Pursuant to the Corporate By-Laws, the remuneration due to the members of the Management Board is
determined by the Supervisory Board. They are also allocated attendance fees for taking part in the
Management Board meetings, as well as in those of the commissions and committees set up by the
Management Board itself to the extent established by the Supervisory Board, and further remuneration is
established by the Supervisory Board for those members of the Management Board vested with specific
offices envisaged by the Corporate By-Laws. In this connection, the Supervisory Board resolved to allocate
each Management Board member an annual fixed remuneration of Euro 150,000 for the three-year period
2010-2011-2012; the traditional attendance fees are included within this fixed amount.
In addition to the remuneration for the office of Board member, the Chairman of the Management Board is
acknowledged an annual remuneration of Euro 500,000, the Deputy Chairman an annual remuneration of
Euro 200,000 and the Chief Executive Officer an annual remuneration as follows: Euro 750,000 as
Executive, Euro 100,000 for a non-competition agreement (for a period of one year from termination of the
appointment), a variable bonus linked to the fixed remuneration deriving from the position of Executive and
Euro 500,000 for the office of Chief Executive Officer. Without prejudice to the matters specified above for
the Chief Executive Officer, the remuneration of the Management Board members is not linked to the
economic results achieved.
Note that on 30 April 2011 the ordinary shareholders’ meeting approved the document “Remuneration and
Incentive Policies” for the UBI Banca Group (“2011 Policy”), among other things, for the Management
Board members and the top management of the Bank and the Group companies (“Top Management”).
With reference to the members of the Management Board, the remuneration policies adopted envisage that
remuneration is fixed to an equal extent with respect to that envisaged for the corresponding roles on the
Supervisory Board. In detail: (i) the Chairman of the Management Board, if undertaking appointments in
other Group banks/companies, may receive an additional overall remuneration no greater than 30% of the
remuneration established for the office of Chairman of the Supervisory Board; (ii) the maximum level of
total emolument which can be received by each Management Board member, with the sole exclusion of the
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, for participation in the Management Board and the other
corporate bodies of the Group companies, is as a rule no greater than 80% of the remuneration for the office
of the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board; (iii) the Management Board
members, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, do not benefit from variable forms of
remuneration linked to results; (iv) the Chief Executive Officer is reserved a variable bonus linked to the 
Section One
169
fixed remuneration deriving from the position as executive; (v) none of the Management Board members can
waive part or all of their remuneration by means of unilateral decision; (vi) guaranteed bonuses or severance
indemnities are not envisaged for the Management Board members; (vii) the attendance fees are included in
the fixed remuneration.
With specific reference to Top Management, the following is envisaged: (i) the deferral of a portion (in
consideration of the role covered) of between 40% and 60% of the bonus; (ii) the introduction of financial
instruments (listed parent company UBI Banca shares) for a portion equating to at least 50% of the variable
remuneration, envisaging an adequate retention period for the same, so as to align the incentives with the
Bank’s medium/long-term interests; and (iii) the existence of a clawback clause, according to which the
definitive allocation of the bonus only takes place in the event of the achievement of specific future
conditions, with provisional and temporary advancing of the related outlay which remains subject to
repayment in the event of fraudulent conduct or gross negligence.

16.4 Acknowledgement of the provisions concerning corporate governance
The Issuer has adapted its corporate governance system to the provisions envisaged by the Consolidated
Finance Act (TUF) and the related implementing provisions and banking legislation – with particular
reference to the specific norms addressing co-operative banks – envisaged by the Consolidated Banking Act
(TUB).
UBI Banca has also adopted a Corporate Governance Code which mainly addresses listed companies with a
traditional governance model and which, under Article 12, lays down that in the event of adoption of a dual
or one-tier management and control system “the previous articles apply in as far as they are compatible,
adapting the individual provisions to the specific model adopted, consistently with the objectives of good
corporate governance, disclosure transparency and protection of the investors and the market pursued by the
Code and in light of the applicative criteria envisaged by this article”.
On 4 March 2008, the Bank of Italy issued the “Supervisory Provisions concerning organisation and
corporate governance of banks”, by means of which it set principles and policies aimed at ensuring the
pursuit of the corporate objectives and guaranteeing sound and prudent management conditions.
Further to the issue of these Supervisory Provisions, the Issuer deemed it appropriate to make a number of
amendments to its Corporate By-Laws, approved by the shareholders’ meeting held on 9 May 2009. By
approving these By-Law amendments, UBI Banca adopted By-Law and internal organisation arrangements
consistent with the principles ratified by the aforementioned Supervisory Provisions of the Bank of Italy.
As at the Prospectus Date, UBI Banca is a co-operative joint-stock company and as such is obliged to
observe the norms envisaged by the Italian Civil Code concerning co-operative companies – with the
exclusion of those expressly listed in Article 150 bis of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB) – as well as 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
184
those which discipline joint-stock companies, in as far as compatible with the regulations for co-operatives,
as indicated in Article 2519 of the Italian Civil Code. The characteristic peculiarities of the nature of cooperative
companies are expressly set out in the Report to UBI Banca’s annual financial statements, an
integral part of the Management Report, which has been drawn up in observance of Article 2545 of the
Italian Civil Code and which states the criteria followed in the corporate operations for the pursuit of the
mutual purpose.
According to Article 30 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB), under the co-operative bank legal status,
each shareholder has the right to one vote whatever the number of shares held and no-one can hold more than
0.50% of the share capital, with the only exception of UCITS, which are subject to the limits set by their
specific regulations. (see Section One, Chapter XVIII, Paragraph 18.1).
UBI Banca has adopted a dual-tier management and control system, deemed to be more in keeping with its
governance needs and at the same time more appropriate for strengthening the protection of the shareholders,
especially via the activities of the Supervisory Board, a body appointed directly by the Shareholders and
representative of the same.
The main characteristics of the dual-tier model involve a distinction between:
 strategic supervision and control functions, assigned to the Supervisory Board, which include a
number of powers which in the traditional system pertain to the shareholders’ meeting (approval of the
financial statements, appointment of the members of the management body and determination of the
related remuneration) and the Board of Statutory Auditors and undertakes “top administration”
functions, since it is required to resolve – upon the Management Board’s proposal – on the definition
of the general programmatic and strategic guidelines of the Bank and Group;
 the corporate management function, assigned to the Management Board, which is exclusively
responsible for carrying out all the transactions necessary for the achievement of the corporate
purpose, whether involving ordinary or extraordinary business, on a consistent basis with the general
programmatic and strategic guidelines approved by the Supervisory Board.
This separation of functions makes it possible to identify distinct moments in the management of the
company and to entrust them to the aforementioned corporate bodies according to their respective roles and
responsibilities, allowing the functioning of a corporate governance system appropriate for the actual set up
of the Bank and Group, through on-going dialogue and interfunctional cooperation.
In conclusion, the Issuer:
 has set up the Internal Control Committee, the Remuneration Committee, as well as the Appointments
Committee, the Accounts Committee and the Related Parties Committee (for further information,
please refer to the corporate governance report attached to the annual financial statements as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2010 and Paragraph 16.3 above);
 has adopted an Internal Control System which, in line with the principles envisaged by the Corporate
Governance Code, the instructions issued in this connection by the Bank of Italy and the Corporate
By-Laws, assigns functions and responsibilities to various bodies, which maintain constant dialogue
and are supported by regular information flows, contributing towards the efficiency and effectiveness
of the same Internal Control System;
 by means of the resolutions of the Management Board dated 6 November 2007 and the Supervisory
Board dated 19 December 2007, has endowed itself with an Organisation, management and control
model pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01;
 has approved the guidelines of the procedure for the handling of privileged information to be
communicated to the general public and for the management of the Register of individuals with access
to privileged information, aimed at outlining the security measures to be adopted suitable for ensuring
maximum confidentiality of the information and defining the procedure to be followed for the
handling and disclosure of privileged information; 
Section One
185
 has adopted specific Internal Dealing Regulations, aimed at adapting the internal regulations and
procedures to the rules concerning disclosure obligations pertinent to transactions carried out on
financial instruments issued by the Issuer or other financial instruments associated with the same by
significant parties and/or individuals closely linked to the same, for the purpose of ensuring the
necessary disclosure transparency and uniformity of information vis-à-vis the market.
Finally, UBI Banca reserves specific attention to the management of on-going relations with shareholders
and financial markets, both domestic and international, and to ensure the systematic disclosure of qualified,
exhaustive and timely information on Group activities, results and strategies.
The Management Board and Shareholder Support division and the Investor Relations divisions have been set
up accordingly.
The Management Board and Shareholder Support division, with regard to the “Shareholder” sphere, manages
relations with the Bank’s Shareholders, prepares the requests for admittance as Shareholder, updates the
Shareholders’ register, seeing to all the corporate requirements. It also co-ordinates the preparatory work for
the Bank’s Shareholders’ meeting and handles all the associated activities. The Investor Relations division
has the task of overseeing relations with the financial community (institutional investors and financial
analysts) within guidelines defined by the Bank’s top management, also through the activation of the
competent company functions and Group companies.
Finally, on 24 November 2010, the Management Board approved its own regulations which discipline
related-party transactions, and defined the internal processes suitable for ensuring observance of the new
rules issued.
As of the same date, the Supervisory Board took steps to internally appoint the Related Parties Committee,
which is required to provide its justified opinion on the existence of UBI Banca’s interest in carrying out
related party transactions falling within the scope of application of the Related Party Regulations as well as
on the appropriateness and correctness of the related conditions.
In this connection, the following transactions have been excluded from the scope of application of the
Related Party Regulations and are therefore not subject to the disclosure obligations laid down by Regulation
17221, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 5 (8), if applicable, of the same Regulation:
a) the general meeting resolutions relating to the remuneration due to Supervisory Board members,
adopted as per Article 2364 bis of the Italian Civil Code, including those concerning the determination
of an overall amount for the remuneration of those supervisory board members vested with specific
roles, powers and functions;
b) the remuneration plans based on financial instruments approved by the shareholders’ meeting in
accordance with Article 22 (b) of the Corporate By-Laws and in compliance with Article 114 bis of the
Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) and related execution operations;
c) the resolutions, other than those indicated under letter a) above, regarding the remuneration of the
management board members vested with specific appointments and the other executives with strategic
responsibilities as well as the resolutions by means of which the Supervisory Board establishes the
remuneration of the management board members, provided that:
i. UBI Banca has adopted a remuneration policy;
ii. the Remuneration Committee established by the Supervisory Board as per Article 49 of the
Corporate By-Laws has been involved in the definition of the remuneration policy;
iii. a report which illustrates the remuneration policy has been submitted for the approval or
advisory vote of the shareholders’ meeting; and
iv. the remuneration allocated is consistent with this policy; 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
186
d) the “Insignificant Amount Transactions”, these being understood to be Related Party Transactions with
a value of less than Euro 250,000. However, if a Related Party Transaction were to be finalised with an
executive with strategic responsibilities, a close family member of the same or with companies
controlled or subject to significant influence by these parties, the same shall be considered to be an
“Insignificant Amount Transaction” if no higher than Euro 100,000;
e) the transactions which fall under the ordinary performance of the operating activities and the related
financial activities concluded at market or standard conditions;
f) the transactions to be carried out on the basis of instructions for stability purposes imparted by
Regulatory Authorities or on the basis of provisions issued by the parent company for the execution of
instructions imparted by the Regulatory Authorities in the interests of Group stability; and
g) the transactions with or between subsidiaries, also jointly controlled, as well as the transactions with
associated companies, if there are no significant interests of other related parties in the subsidiaries or
associated companies party to the transaction.
Furthermore, in compliance with the indications provided by Consob, UBI Banca transactions with related
parties carried out by subsidiaries are also subject to the regulations in question if, by virtue of the provisions
of the Corporate By-Laws or internal procedures adopted by the Bank, the Management Board, the
Supervisory Board upon the proposal of the Management Board or also a Bank representative by virtue of
the authority granted the same, must examine or approve a transaction to be carried out by subsidiaries in
advance.
The procedures to be applied in the event of transactions of greater significance, transactions of minor
significance and strategic operations have been disciplined in the Related Party Regulations.
As a rule, on a similar basis to the provisions of Article 2391 of the Italian Civil Code envisaged for the
members of the Management Board, at Corporate By-Law level it is also envisaged that the members of the
Supervisory Board must report any interest which, on their own account or for third parties, they have in a
specific Company or Group transaction, specifying the nature, terms, origin and extent. The related
resolution adopted by the Supervisory Board must adequately justify the reasons and the convenience of the
transaction for the Company, without prejudice to any other applicable legal or regulatory provision.
In relation to the current legislative provisions issued implementing the “MiFID” 2004/39/EC Directive, an
“internal policy for handling personal transactions” was approved, disciplining in detail the obligations
concerning personal transactions on financial instruments pertaining to all significant parties, as identified in
the aforementioned rules.
For further information on the UBI Banca corporate governance system, reference should be made to the
annual report – for 2010 – on corporate governance and ownership structure, filed pursuant to and within the
terms of the law, as available on the Issuer’s website (www.ubibanca.it), as well as on the Borsa Italiana
website (www.borsaitaliana.it).

With the aim of further reducing operating risk, focusing on and investing in activities typical of offering
products/services to customers, on 20 May 2010 the industrial relations procedure, which commenced on 26
March 2010, was concluded, aimed at significantly reducing costs and the structural cost of labour in
particular (the “Agreement”). The Agreement envisages a reduction of the Group’s total personnel by 895,
of which 500 via an incentivised exit plan for employees who have accrued pension rights by 31 December
2011, which concluded on 1 October 2010. As regards the remainder, the reduction will be achieved via
management measures including partial replacement of staff turnover. As at the Prospectus Date this staff
reduction process concerned a total of 821 employees.
To ensure the required operating continuity for the areas concerned by the organisational review processes,
during Q4 of 2010 UBI Banca also transformed 550 temporary employment contracts, concerning younger
resources already working in the Group, into permanent contracts. The total cost of the measure was Euro
33.2 million — taking account of the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 78/2010, amended into Law no.
122/2010 — recognised in the half-yearly income statement, which was divided between incentives for those
who have already accrued pension rights and use of the Solidarity Fund prescribed by Ministerial Decree no.
158 of 2000. Overall, the Agreement, together with the other management measures to be implemented, will
allow for personnel cost savings amounting to around Euro 70 million, of which Euro 10-15 million was
recognised in 2010.
The following table illustrates the total number of staff employed by the Group as at 31 December 2010,
2009 and 2008, with a breakdown of the numbers employed in Italy and overseas.

20.6 Dividend policy
Pursuant to Article 17 of the Corporate By-Laws, participation in the equity and profits is proportional to the
shares held, and dividends that continue to be uncollected by the fifth year of the date on which they became
available will revert to the Company and be allocated to the legal reserve.
Pursuant to Article 22 (d) of the Corporate By-Laws, the distribution of the profits is approved by the
Company’s ordinary shareholders’ meeting, following approval of the financial statements by the
Supervisory Board. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
202
Pursuant to Article 52 of the Corporate By-Laws, the shareholders’ meeting can designate up to 1.5 percent
of the distributable portion of the net profits after deduction of the legal reserve according to the minimum
provided by the law and any amounts decided by the shareholders’ meeting for constitution and increasing of
the reserves, including extraordinary or other reserves, according to prudential policies, for charity,
humanitarian, social, cultural and artistic purposes which the Management Board will carry out according to
the instructions and the projects resolved upon by the Supervisory Board and upon the indication of the
Chairman of the Management Board, with particular emphasis on the territories the Group is operative in.
The remainder is distributed as a dividend upon resolution of the shareholders’ meeting which also decides in
relation to the usage of any excess.
The Management Board may resolve to distribute, during the year, advances against the dividend as provided
for by legislation in force.
On 9 May 2009, the Issuer’s ordinary shareholders’ meeting approved the distribution of the unit dividend of
Euro 0.45 each for the 639,145,902 UBI shares, for a total of Euro 287,615,655.90.
On 24 April 2010, the Issuer’s ordinary shareholders’ meeting approved the distribution of the unit dividend
of Euro 0.30 each for the 639,145,902 UBI shares, for a total of Euro 191,743,770.60.
On 30 April 2011, the Issuer’s ordinary shareholders’ meeting approved the distribution of the unit dividend
of Euro 0.15 each for the 639,146,170 UBI shares, for a total of Euro 95,871,925.50.
20.7 Court proceedings and arbitration
As part of the normal execution of its operations, the UBI Banca Group is a party in numerous court
proceedings of different types.
The Issuer has established in its consolidated financial statements a provision for legal costs for the liabilities
that could ensue from the pending litigation and other disputes under way. As at 31 December 2010, this
amount equalled EUR 113.9 million (Euro 108.7 million as at 31 March 2011).
As the final outcome cannot be foreseen with certainty, the Issuer believes that any unfavourable outcome of
these proceedings shall not have a significant negative effect on the financial and economic situation of the
UBI Banca Group, whether individually or as a whole.
Below is a brief description of the main proceedings under way, with an indication of the amount demanded
by the counterparty where this has been determined.
Mariella Burani Group
In regard to the insolvency proceedings of Mariella Burani Family Holding S.p.A. (“MBFH”), Burani
Designer Holding N.V. (“BDH”), Burani Private Holding S.p.A. (“BPH”) and Mariella Burani Fashion
Group S.p.A. (“MBFG”), Centrobanca has been definitively admitted as a creditor in all the proceedings
relating to the receivable arising from the loan granted in August 2008 to MBFH for the takeover bid of the
MBFG shares and the receivables from other loans granted between March 2004 and June 2007 to MBFG..
The overall exposure to the Burani Group of Euro 88 million was adjusted by Euro 56.5 million in 2009 and
by a further Euro 11.3 million in 2010. Another Euro 2 million was added to these amounts as a provision for
risks arising from a potential clawback action against MBFH by Centrobanca, again in 2010.
In January 2011 Centrobanca received a letter from BDH’s bankruptcy receiver in which Centrobanca is
accused of being responsible for the bankruptcy of BDH due to its role in the takeover bid and the
impairment of the MBFG shares held by BDH, with a request for compensation of approximately Euro 134
million (equal to the average value indicated by the court’s special consultant for the shares held by BDH in
MBFG prior to the takeover bid). With the assistance of external attorneys, Centrobanca firmly rebuked all
claims on 9 February 2011. 
Section One
203
Giacomelli Sport Group clawback action
As at the Prospectus Date, proceedings relating to bankruptcy clawback actions are pending against Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Carime and Banca
Regionale Europea, by the bankruptcy receivership of Giacomelli Sport S.p.A., for Euro 84,775,557.
Formenti Seleco S.p.A. clawback action
As at the Prospectus Date, proceedings are pending relating to a bankruptcy clawback action brought by
Formenti Seleco S.p.A., which is currently under extraordinary administration, against Banco di Brescia, for
Euro 1,447,453. On 24 March 2011 the expert witness testified and was rebuked by Banco di Brescia. The
judge postponed the case until 13 October 2011. Furthermore, in addition to the clawback action against
Banco di Brescia, the extraordinary administration of Formenti Seleco S.p.A. has also sued another 18
entities for abusive granting of loans for a claimed amount of Euro 45,608,320.
In the first instance ruling on 8 February 2011, the Court of Monza declared a lack of standing to sue by the
plaintiff with awarding of the legal costs.
Proceedings referring to Olivetti warrants
Proceedings are pending at the Court of Milan against Banca Popolare di Bergamo with regard to the
purchase of Olivetti covered warrants and warrants (the latter through Internet banking) for a total amount of
Euro 5,630,000. In addition to claiming lack of information regarding the risks inherent in covered
transactions, the counterparty declared that it refuses to acknowledge the signatures on the contracts which
are required by the law on financial and capital instruments. Subsequently, the counterparty recognised the
signatures that it had initially refused to acknowledge but brought an action for forgery as it claimed to have
signed blank sheets which were subsequently abusively filled out by the bank. The court has not yet ruled on
the admissibility of this lawsuit.
Centrobanca lawsuits
Centrobanca is a plaintiff in two proceedings, one of which involves a public sector counterparty concerning
restitution of a guarantee of approximately Euro 20 million, the appeal for which is pending after the
favourable outcome of the first instance ruling and another in which Centrobanca is a defendant in a
bankruptcy proceeding for a claimed amount of approximately Euro 65 million, which is currently still being
examined by the judge of first instance who has requested a preliminary expert opinion aimed at ascertaining
whether, in the period the proceedings refers to, the company which then began bankruptcy proceedings, did
actually incur damages and to what extent. It is presumed that the appraiser’s report will be submitted within
the current year.
Transaction with Pasquale Casale, Benedetto Marti and Casale, Marti & Associati S.p.A.
Following inspections that took place from July 2009 until February 2010, in which facts and situations
involving bad management and organisation by terminated directors of IW bank emerged, the ordinary
shareholders’ meeting of IW Bank on 6 April 2010 authorised the Board of Directors, upon proposal of UBI
Banca, to sue the former CEO Pasquale Casale for liability, pursuant to Article 2393 (2) of the Italian Civil
Code; he had previously been served a legal challenge in relation to his liability for bad management.
During the shareholders’ meeting of 24 September 2010, it was decided to withdraw the liability action
against the terminated CEO Pasquale Casale within the context of a wider settlement agreement concluded in
July 2010 between UBI Banca and IW Bank on one hand, and Pasquale Casale and other third-party
individuals and entities (Benedetto Marti, the former operating Deputy Chairman of IW Bank and Casale,
Marti & Associati S.p.A.) on the other hand, which definitively ended the lawsuit between the parties. The
essential terms of the agreement provide for:
- payment of a lump sum of Euro 2.5 million to IW Bank, which was paid to the latter upon conclusion
of the settlement agreement and recognised in the third quarter of 2010 (Euro 2.1 million net of the
legal expenses and the writing-off of payables towards the former corporate executives). As provided 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
204
in the agreement, this amount constitutes fulfilment of the reciprocal obligations set forth in the
agreement, up to the amount of Euro 1,250,000;
- the signing by Casale, Marti & Associati S.p.A. and Messrs. Casale and Marti, of a non-competition
commitment until 31 March 2011 and the commitment not to hire or solicit, up to that same date,
employees, associates, promoters or customers of IW Bank and UBI Banca;
- commitment by Pasquale Casale and Benedetto Marti to sell to UBI Banca all the shares held by them
in IW Bank (through the companies Giudoca and Ottotto) and their consequent commitment not to
purchase shares in IW Bank, either directly or through a third party, for a period of 12 months
following the aforementioned sale;
- renunciation by Pasquale Casale of all claims against IW Bank arising from his previous employment
as General Director.
Transaction with Enterprise S.p.A.
IW Bank and information technology supplier Enterprise S.p.A. concluded a settlement agreement in July
2010 defining all the pending items relating to the relations between IW Bank and Enterprise S.p.A. prior to
that agreement. The transaction also provides that Enterprise S.p.A. shall guarantee to IW Bank, and with the
requisite professional diligence, the continuation of the services agreed upon up to completion of all
activities relating to the migration of the information system of IW Bank onto the system provided by the
Cedacri company, which took place in February 2011. Economically, the settlement agreement provided for
full and final payment to the outsourcer of a total amount of Euro 1.5 million approximately; the settlement
agreement was then supplemented due to new procurement which arose in the meantime and the relative
amounts payable were defined in the supplementary agreements stipulated from time to time.
CIT S.p.A. dispute.
In March 2011, a writ of summons was served on Banco di Brescia by a former director of CIT S.p.A. (in
receivership since 2006) to appear before the Court of Milan on 14 June 2011 to determine the liability of
Banco di Brescia, along with five other leading credit institutions (jointly and severally), CIT S.p.A. directors
and several auditing firms (all of which are also defendants), in the deterioration of the situation of CIT
S.p.A.
This writ followed a lawsuit brought against the plaintiff at the Court of Milan by the official receiver for
CIT S.p.A. (in receivership) aimed at having the plaintiff, as a director, admit to his liability for the financial
difficulties of the company. Since the judge rejected the plaintiff’s petition to have the aforementioned
entities join the suit brought against him, the former director of CIT S.p.A. served the writ of summons to
initiate a separate suit.
The amount being sought is Euro 151,732,000, which, as indicated in the writ of summons, is equal to 50%
of the loss reported by CIT S.p.A. in 2002 and allegedly corresponds (again, as noted in the writ of
summons) to the amount sought in the lawsuit brought by CIT S.p.A. against the former director of the latter.
This suit, which as of the Prospectus Date was being prepared for trial, was recently assigned to outside legal
counsel so as to prepare briefs in defence of the bank.
On this matter we inform you that, as at the Prospectus Date, regarding this dispute Banca di Brescia has not
decided to make any provisions (allocated at this date solely to legal costs). We can inform you moreover
that Banco di Brescia was granted the status of secured creditor by the bankruptcy proceedings, in the total
amount of Euro 7,639,922.22.
Consob-Bank of Italy claims
In 2010, the Bank of Italy and Guardia di Finanza (Finance Police) served eleven “reports on findings” to
nine branch managers of Banca Popolare di Ancona, in relation to failure to provide notifications as required
by the anti money laundering regulations. In nine cases, the aforementioned findings were also served on
Banca Popolare di Ancona as the jointly and severally responsible party. 
Section One
205
The “defence” was submitted to the Ministry of Economy and Finance within the required time and the bank
has made the appropriate prudential allocations.
With its Resolution no. 17727 of 29 March 2011, which was served on 6 April 2011, Consob applied
administrative fines to twelve corporate executives of IW Bank and, in its capacity as a jointly and severally
liable party, to the Issuer, upon completion of the administrative proceedings which had begun with the
report on findings of 12 April 2010 for violation of Article 187 nonies of the Consolidated Finance Act
(TUF) and the relative implementation measures issued by Consob for the period from 1 January 2007 – 3
December 2008. The overall amount of the fines, which vary from a maximum of Euro 32,000 to a minimum
of Euro 12,000 against the individual executives, amounts to Euro 252,900.
The proceedings which resulted in the application of the fines were launched by the Consob Market Division
–Spot Markets Department, following the investigations carried out at IW Bank from 13 March 2008 to 3
December 2008.
Consob-Bank of Italy investigations
In February 2010, the Bank of Italy began investigations pursuant to Articles 54 and 68 of the Consolidated
Banking Act (TUB) which aim to assess the profile of the Group with regard to governance, management
and control of credit risk in the corporate customer segment, also in relation to the progress made in the
introduction of a system for the measurement of risk based on internal ratings. The investigations which, in
addition to UBI Banca, also involve other Group banks, were concluded at the end of July 2010.
With its memorandum of 23 September 2010, the regulatory authority announced further investigations,
pursuant to Article 68 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB), aimed at measuring the Group’s profile in
terms of liquidity risk and interest rate risk as part of the periodic prudent governance and management
control process. These investigations were concluded in December 2010.
On the outcome of the enquiries, the Regulatory Authority found certain weaknesses in the systems in place
for the management control of the financial structure and liquidity and interest-rate risk.
UBI Banca promptly illustrated to the Regulatory Body the measures already undertaken and those the
Group intends to apply with the maximum priority as part of mitigating the weaknesses highlighted, with
particular regard to the recommended measures for strategic planning (bringing forward the imminent
approval of the Industrial Plan then to 13 May 2011), which highlighted the primary guidelines for capital
stability, profit capacity and a balanced development of the financial structure.
Furthermore UBI Banca initiated and reinforced specific activities dedicated to governing financial risks,
while at the same time increasing the level of coordination of the various component entities of the Group.
Finally, on 28 January 2011 the Bank of Italy announced new investigations involving the UBI Banca Group,
again pursuant to Article 68 of the Consolidated Banking Act (TUB), on the governance and measurement of
the risks assumed by product companies that consistently use distribution networks (UBI Banca Private
Investment and B@nca 24-7) or that operate online (IW Bank).
Bank of Italy penalties
On 13 December 2010, the Bank of Italy levied administrative fines amounting to Euro 532,000 against
members of the Board of Directors, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the General Manager of Prestitalia
S.p.A.. The fines refer to the irregularities discovered during the investigations conducted from 16 September
to 4 December 2009, when UBI Banca held an indirect shareholding of only 22.8395%, following which the
regulatory authority had issued, on 3 March 2010, a temporary suspension of the activity pending
recapitalisation of the Company. The equity was increased in March concurrently with the conclusion of
agreements for acquisition of control of Prestitalia S.p.A.
The litigation regarding compounding
After March 1999, the Court of Cassation changed its orientation and no longer upheld as legitimate the
quarterly capitalisation of debit interest on current accounts, by taking the meaning of the contractual clause 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
206
that provides for it as having a “commercial” rather than a “regulatory” meaning, and therefore not
appropriate for derogating from the definitive regulation of Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code that forbids
compounding interest. Subsequently Legislative Decree no. 342/99 maintained the legitimacy of non-annual
capitalisation of interest on current bank accounts, provided the same rules apply for debit interest as for
credit interest. All current accounts were adjusted following the entry into force of this new regulation in
April 2000, with a provision for the quarterly capitalisation of both credit and debit interest. The litigation
therefore arose solely for account agreements entered into prior to this date.
With a United Sections judgement of 2 December 2010, the Court of Cassation intervened on the additional
question of the ten-year provision where the account holder is entitled to a refund of interest paid unduly,
ordering that the term runs from the date of closure of the account where the agreement has been maintained
within the limits of the overdraft while, in cases where the account has been used in excess of or without any
agreed overdraft, this term shall run from the date when payments credited were made to wholly or partly
restore preceding interest debits.
Regardless of the application of these principles applying to agreements entered into prior to 2000, it is
considered that it would not be possible to estimate the impact this decision will have on the existing cases
and on those that will arise in the future, as the possibility of seeing the compensation claimed by account
holders being changed in size by the limitation will vary case-by-case. Also in light of the different attitude
arising from case law, according to the availability of the proof regarding the existence or otherwise of the
overdraft on the current accounts into which the quarterly interest was paid and according to the method the
agreed overdrafts were used. The risks arising from it have been tackled by prompt and prudent allocation to
the Provisions for risks and charges.
Lastly, we inform you that with Law no. 10/11 published in the Official Journal no. 47 of 26 February 2011,
converting Law Decree no. 225 of 29 December 2010 (the so-called “Decreto Mille Proroghe”), the
legislature intervened with a regulation that on one hand provides authentic interpretation regarding the
commencement of the ten-year limitation, setting out that in banking transactions in current accounts, the
relative term runs from the date of the individual account entries, and on the other hand, specifies that
amounts already paid on the date of entry into force of the aforesaid conversion law are excluded, and
therefore cannot be repeated. In the absence of the practical outcome of the interpretation of these two
principles, it is impossible to provide an exact estimate of the value of the litigation. Questions of
constitutional legitimacy under various formulations have been raised against this legislative provision and
the relative judgement by the Constitutional Court is therefore pending.
The tax dispute
In 2010 and the three years prior to 2010, the tax authorities carried out several tax audits of UBI Banca and
several of the Group companies. These activities mainly concerned adjustment of the declared taxable
income and the application procedures of the tax regulations in regard to withholding taxes. Following this,
the Issuer and Group companies received various investigation reports, partially confirmed with assessments.
Below are the main assessments and notices received.
The assessment notices received to date amount to a total of Euro 161.83 million (higher taxes assessed and
relative penalties), while the higher taxes payable, based on the reports, are estimated at approximately Euro
33.38 million, for a maximum total potential risk of Euro 195.21 million (this estimate does not include any
interest payable).
The contingent liabilities which are classified as probable amount to approximately Euro 13.6 million and
appropriate allocations to provisions have been made. The remaining disputes are classified as possible, also
on the basis of external opinions, and as such and based on the accounting principles of reference, no
allocations have been made.
In this regard it should be noted that in the first quarter of 2011, a tax audit was initiated by the Regional
Revenue Office of the Marche Region at Banca Popolare di Ancona with regard to the tax year 2008. With
the exception of this audit, in the first quarter of 2011 the Tax Authorities did not initiate any other tax audits
at Group companies, and there were no further events other than those reported as at 31 December 2010. 
Section One
207
Below are the main assessment notices and tax assessment reports served by the tax authorities from 2008 to

been set.
UBI Banca (2003): higher taxes Euro 5.3 million, penalties Euro 6.4 million.
This refers to a real estate sale which was redefined by the Inland Revenue service as a transferral of assets.
A decision entirely favourable to the Company was made by the Provincial Tax Commission of Bergamo,
through which an appeal was made to the Regional Tax Commission of Lombardy.
UBI Banca (2004 and 2005): higher taxes Euro 8.83 million, penalties Euro 10.86 million.
This involved the alleged failure to apply withholdings on interest paid to a foreign subsidiary on its
deposits, which were redefined by the assessors as loans. This involved complex operations for increasing
the equity which were carried out in 2001 upon the authorisation of the Bank of Italy. Based on authoritative
opinions it is considered that the tax regime applied by the Bank, at the time Banca Popolare di Bergamo and
Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, is in line with contractual and regulatory provisions. As this is an
issue that spans several years, the assessment notices for 2004 and 2005 have been served to date. For the
latter year an appeal was made while for 2004 the Provincial Tax Commission of Milan ruled in its hearing
held on 2 December 2010 that the collection of the amount assessed was to be suspended pending a
discussion to be held in the upcoming months.
Banco di Brescia (2004 and 2005): higher taxes Euro 3.16 million, penalties Euro 3.92 million.
This involved the alleged failure to apply withholdings on interest paid to a foreign subsidiary on its
deposits, which were redefined by the assessors as loans. These related to complex operations for increasing
the equity which were carried out in 2000 upon the authorisation of the Bank of Italy. Based on authoritative
opinions it is considered that the tax regime applied by Banco di Brescia is in line with contractual and
regulatory provisions. The relative tax claims have been appealed before the Provincial Tax Commission of
Milan. Pending the ruling regarding the 2004 amount, the tax of Euro 953,000 which the Banco di Brescia
had to pay was assessed.
UBI Leasing (2004): higher taxes Euro 2.15 million, penalties Euro 2.3 million.
Alleged improper application of the reduced VAT rate on nautical leasing transactions, i.e., undue deduction
of VAT on invoices for non-existent transactions, as well as improper quantification of loan write-downs for
IRES (corporate income tax) purposes. At this time, the Inland Revenue service has provisionally assessed
only the amount referring to the IRES issues totalling Euro 22,000.
Banco di Brescia (2004): higher taxes Euro 1.5 million, penalties Euro 1.5 million.
Alleged lack of right to intervene on negative income components and improper assessment of securities
owned. The Inland Revenue service has assessed the amount. As part of the second level assessment, the
Inland Revenue service has assessed the amount for the Bank at Euro 901,000 which the bank has settled.

Tax assessment reports (TAR)
Centrobanca (2006): higher taxes Euro 3 million.
The Inland Revenue service does not concur with the recognition criteria for granting of loans to customers
and write-downs thereof, even in the presence of the taxable principle introduced for IAS entities since 2005.
The company’s conduct is also supported by adequate opinions from external advisers. Certain observations
were made against the comments in the TARs, as provided by the taxpayer rights statute (Law 212/2000). In
consideration of the amount of comments, the assessors have notified the District Attorney of Milan and the
relative discussion is currently under way.
UBI Banca (2006): higher taxes Euro 4.4 million.
This is the same issue as described regarding the assessment notices for 2004 and 2005.
UBI Leasing (2005 -2007): higher taxes Euro 3.7 million.
This is the same issue as described regarding the assessment notices for 2004.
UBI Banca (2003): higher taxes Euro 18 million.
This involves an alleged undue reduction of IRPEG (corporate tax) from several negative income
components relating to the transfer of a company carried out in 2003 which gave rise to the former Banche
Popolari Unite Group. In addition to the unfoundedness thereof, the parent company objected that the
assessment was void as it applied to a year (2003) for which assessment rights expired on 31 December
2008, while the assessment took place in 2010.
There are additional tax disputes which mainly refer to years prior to 31 December 2007 and mainly concern
the following issues:
UBI Banca (years from 1976 to 1984): higher taxes Euro 18.6 million.
These are disputes which are pending before the Central Tax Commission, which to a large extent have
already received favourable rulings in 2010 and which will be decided upon during this year provided no
appeals are submitted to the Court of Cassation. They refer to the deductibility criteria in terms of IRPEG
and ILOR of various cost items as they specifically referred to assets from which taxable revenues and
income derive, and also to the non-taxable nature in IRPEG-ILOR terms of interest due from the Inland
Revenue service on tax credits, in light of the legislation then in force (prior to the TUIR as per Presidential
Decree 917/1986).
Lastly we note that a new tax audit began in March 2011 regarding 2008 at Banca Popolare di Ancona.
20.8 Significant changes in the financial or commercial situation of the Issuer after 31 March 2011
Exception made for the above, the Issuer is not aware of any significant changes in the financial or
commercial situation of the Group that took place subsequently to the closing of the quarter ended as at 31
March 2011.
On 19 April 2011, the procedure was concluded for the purchase of the total shares of IW bank through
deposit of the purchase price of Euro 2.043 for each IW Bank share with the intermediary in charge of
coordinating the collection for sales requests on the MTA – electronic trading platform (see Section One,
Chapter V, Paragraph 5.1.5). With effect from that date, the ordinary shares of IW Bank were removed from
listing on the MTA. The price from delisting IW Bank shares has not led to their impairment.
Finally, on 13 May 2011, the appropriate corporate bodies of UBI approved the Industrial Plan (see Section
One, Chapter XIII).

free of charge to the shareholders of the Issuer, which entitle the holder to subscribe 1 UBI Share per 20
Warrants held, at the price of Euro 12.30.
Convertible Bond known as UBI 2009/2013 convertibile con facoltà di rimborso in azioni
As at the Prospectus Date there was a convertible bond issue outstanding known as the UBI 2009/2013
convertibile con facoltà di rimborso in azioni (the “Convertible Bond”), whose issue was resolved by the
Management Board, and was subject to the favourable opinion of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to the
mandate assigned to the Management Board by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting held on 9 May 2009,
for a nominal value of Euro 639,145,872, comprising 50,129,088 Convertible Bonds with a par value of Euro
12.75 each, issued by UBI Banca on 10 July 2009 at an issue price of 100% of the par value.
The Convertible Bonds are traded on the MTA with the ISIN code IT0004506868.
The Convertible Bonds are regulated by the Regulations applied to Convertible Bonds UBI 2009/2013
convertibile con facoltà di rimborso in azioni (the “CB Regulations”) which must be considered included
herein by reference pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/71/EC and Article 28 of Regulation (EC)
809/2004. This document was previously published and submitted to Consob and is publicly available on the
Issuer’s website (www.ubibanca.it) and at the Issuer’s registered offices and those of Borsa Italiana.
The CB has a duration from 10 July 2009 (the “Issue Date”) to 10 July 2013 (the “Maturity Date”).
Bondholders are entitled to receive an annual fixed coupon of 5.75% gross of the par value, on 10 July of
each year during the life of the CB.
Unless in the event of the suspension referred to in Article 7 of the CB Regulations, the option to convert the
Bonds into UBI Shares may be exercised no earlier than 18 (eighteen) months from the Issue Date (i.e., 10
January 2011) at a ratio of 1 UBI Share (the “CB Converted Shares”) per each Convertible Bond presented
for conversion (the “Conversion Ratio”).
The CB Converted Shares will be made available, by means of Monte Titoli, on the third exchange business
day of the calendar month following the month of submission of the conversion application. The CB
Converted Shares will be entered on to the Monte Titoli centralised management system and will have the
same rights as the UBI shares traded on the MTA on the conversion date.
In the event of submission of conversion applications by Bondholders, the Issuer has the option to fulfil the
obligation of delivering CB Converted Shares by paying, in place of the CB Converted Shares, a cash
amount equal to the market price of the CB Converted Shares calculated according to the arithmetic average
of official prices (as defined in the Stock Exchange Regulations) of the UBI Share price reported during the
period of four exchange business days prior to and the four exchange business days following the option
exercise date. With regard to this it is noted that on 19 March 2010 the Management Board resolved
irrevocably not to exercise the cash settlement option referred to in this article if the market value of the UBI
shares, during the period and under the conditions indicated in the CB Regulations, is greater Euro 12.80. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
210
With regard to the Conversion Ratio, Article 9 of the CB Regulations sets out that if, between the Issue Date
and the Maturity Date of the Bonds, operations are carried out on the Issuer’s share capital, the Conversion
Ratio will be adjusted by the Issuer.
With specific reference to the circumstance where the Issuer implements share capital increases for payment
or issues bonds convertible into UBI shares, warrants on UBI shares or other similar instruments offered as
options to the shareholders of the Issuer, this option will also be attributed, under the same terms and
conditions, to the Bondholders, based on the Conversion Ratio.
Lastly, please note that as at the Prospectus Date, 268 Convertible Bonds have been converted into 268 new
UBI Banca ordinary shares, for a total nominal value of Euro 3,417.
UBI Banca 2009/2011 warrants, Warrant Azioni Ordinarie UBI Banca 2009-2011
On 9 May 2009 the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of the Company resolved, inter alia, to issue
639,145,900 UBI Banca 2009/2011 warrants, Warrant azioni ordinarie UBI Banca 2009/2011 (the
“Warrants”), to be assigned free of charge to shareholders of the Company on 18 May 2009, at a ratio of 1
Warrant per each share held, entitling the holder to subscribe at maturity ordinary shares of the Company at a
ratio of 1 share for every 20 Warrants at the price of Euro 12.30 for each newly issued ordinary share. Solely
for serving the fulfilment of the Warrants, the shareholders’ meeting approved a share capital increase,
divisible and for payment, for a maximum total value (inclusive of share premium) of Euro 393,074,729, to
be completed no later than 31 December 2011, via the issue of a maximum of 31,957,295 ordinary shares,
with regular entitlements (the “Conversion Shares”). The Management Board was engaged to implement the
issue.
The Warrants were assigned free of charge to the shareholders of the Issuer, and made available on 21 May
2009, without any brokerage activities, by means of the authorised intermediaries belonging to the
centralised management system of Monte Titoli, upon the release on 18 May 2009 of coupon 8 at a ratio of 1
Warrant per every 1 UBI Share held.
The Warrants are traded separately on the MTA from the UBI shares, with ISIN code IT0004495187.
The Warrants are governed by the Regulations applied to the UBI Banca 2009/2011 warrants Warrant azioni
ordinarie UBI Banca 2009/2011 (the “Warrant Regulations”), which must be considered included herein
by reference pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/71/EC and Article 28 of Regulation (EC) 809/2004.
This document was previously published and submitted to Consob and is publicly available on the Issuer’s
website (www.ubibanca.it) and at the Issuer’s registered offices and those of Borsa Italiana.
The Warrants entitle the shareholders and their assignees to subscribe 1 Conversion Share every 20 Warrants
held (the “Exercise Ratio”), at the Price of Euro 12.30 (the “Exercise Price”).
With the exception of the events of suspension envisaged by Article 5 of the Warrant Regulations, the
Warrants may be exercised for a period of 30 calendar days from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2011 (the “Exercise
Period”) solely via the submission, during the Exercise Period, of an appropriate subscription request (the
“Exercise Request”) to the authorised intermediaries belonging to the centralised management system of
Monte Titoli where the Warrants are held.
The Conversion Shares will be made available, by means of Monte Titoli, on the fifth exchange business day
of the calendar month following the month of submission of the Exercise Request. The Conversion Shares
will have regular dividend entitlement and the same characterisitics as the UBI shares outstanding on the
effective date of exercise of the Warrants.
As regards the Exercise Ratio and the Exercise Price of the Warrants, Article 7 of the Warrant Regulations
provides that, if transactions on UBI Banca’s share capital are resolved upon and implemented between the
issue date of the Warrants and the date on which the Conversion Shares are made available to the Warrant
holders, the Exercise Ratio and the Exercise Price, may be adjusted by UBI Banca.
In particular, in the event of share capital increases against payment in cash, to be implemented through the
issue of new shares to be offered under option to the assignees, or of other transactions that give rise to a 
Section One
211
negotiable right, the Exercise Price of each Warrant will be decreased by an amount, expressed in Euros and
rounded to the nearest third decimal point, equal to:
(Pcum - Pex) × 20 × Exercise Ratio
where:
- “Pcum” indicates the simple arithmetic mean of the last three official prices “cum rights” of the
Bank’s ordinary shares recorded on the MTA;
- “Pex” indicates the ratio between: i) the sum of the number of shares on the market prior to the capital
increase multiplied by Pcum and the new shares issued multiplied by the issue price of the new shares
and ii) the total number of shares outstanding after the capital increase.
In no case may the Exercise Price be increased as a result of application of the preceding formula (even if
Pex is greater than Pcum). In the same way, in no case may the Exercise Price, as redetermined based on the
preceding formula, be lower than the par value of the Conversion Share, as modified from time to time and
excepting the case in which, as a result of an amendment to UBI Banca’s Corporate By-Laws, the par value
of the shares is not indicated in accordance with Article 2346 (3) of the Italian Civil Code.
According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Warrant Regulations, UBI Banca will determine the Exercise
Price and will inform the Warrant holders through a public notice published in at least one national
newspaper and on the Bank’s web site www.ubibanca.it.
21.1.2 Shares not representative of the share capital

21.1.5 Existence of purchase rights and/or obligations on authorised but not issued capital or of a
constraint on the capital increase
On 9 May 2009 the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of the Company resolved:
- to approve a divisible company share capital increase, for payment, for a maximum total value
(inclusive of share premium) of Euro 393,074,728.5 via the issue of a maximum number of
31,957,295 ordinary shares with a par value of Euro 2.50, with regular rights, to be reserved solely for
the exercise of the Warrants, to be exercised no later than 31 December 2011;
- to authorise, pursuant to Article 2420-ter of the Italian Civil Code, the Management Board with the
facility to issue, in one or more tranches, subject to the authorisation of the Supervisory Board, no later

of the mandate conferred on the board by the resolution of the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of
9 May 2009, resolved to issue 50,129,088 convertible bonds, with a par value of Euro 12.75 each, for
a total nominal amount of Euro 639,145,872.00, to be offered as options to the eventual shareholders

On 30 April 2011 the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of the Company resolved:
- to authorise, pursuant to Article 2443 of the Italian Civil Code, the Management Board, subject to the
authorisation of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital by payment in cash, in one or
more issues, within 12 months from the date of the resolution, by a total maximum amount of Euro 1

characteristics as those outstanding, to be offered for payment in cash to the shareholders and the
holders of the convertible bond “UBI 2009/2013 convertibile con facoltà di rimborso in azioni”, with
the broadest powers for the Management Board to set, from time to time and in observance of the
above limitations, the procedures, the terms and the conditions of the operation, including the issue

financial position of the Bank and the Group which it leads as well as market practices for similar
transactions.
On 13 May 2011, the Management Board of the Issuer, in execution of the authorisation granted to it, after

currently outstanding and regular dividend entitlement, to be offered under option to the Company’s
shareholders and holders of the Convertible Bonds, on the basis of the conversion ratio specified in
Article 5 of the Convertible Bond Regulations;
- to establish that if, by the final deadline of 31 December 2011, the Capital Increase has not been fully
subscribed, the share capital is to be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to subscriptions
gathered by that date;
- to determine, at a future meeting of the Management Board to be called in the days immediately
preceding the launch of the Offer, subject to authorisation of the Supervisory Board, and in the forms
indicated in Article 2443 of the Italian Civil Code, i) the per-share issue price of UBI Shares including
share premium, which is to be determined taking into account, among other things, prevailing market
conditions at the time the transaction is actually launched; market prices for ordinary UBI shares; the
economic, capital and financial position of the Company and the Group, and the market practices for
similar transactions; ii) the number of UBI Shares to be issued and the final amount of the Capital

With the exception of that described below, as at the Prospectus Date there is no interest in the capital of UBI

assignment to the parties of call options on the respective investments in that SGR (Asset management

The Supervisory Board and its members shall exercise the powers provided for in Article 151 bis of the
Consolidated Finance Act (TUF), according to the terms and conditions set out therein.
Methods of appointing the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board comprises 23 Directors appointed by the shareholders’ meeting from among
Shareholders having the requirements of integrity, professionalism and independence set out by current
regulations. At least 15 members of the Supervisory Board must have the requirements of professionalism set
out by temporary regulations in force for individuals holding administrative offices with banks.
In particular, at least 3 members of the Supervisory Board must be selected from among individuals
registered with the Registry of Legal Auditors who have carried out legal auditing of accounts for a period no
less than 3 years.
For the election of the members of the Supervisory Board, the shareholders’ meeting shall proceed on the
basis of lists, with the methods and terms set out in Article 45 of the Corporate By-Laws.
Specifically, the lists of candidates, signed by those submitting them, must be submitted to the corporate
address between 30 and 13 days prior to the date of the first Shareholders’ meeting and shall provide the
names of at least two candidates. The lists may also be submitted via a remote method of communication, set
by the Management Board, using methods made known in the notice of call, that enable identification of the
individuals making the submission. The signature of each submitting Shareholder must be duly authenticated
pursuant to law or by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries duly mandated by the Management
Board.
The lists must also include information relating to the identity of the shareholders submitting them, with an
indication of the number of shares and therefore the total percentage held by the submitting shareholders and,
within the terms set out by current regulations, a notification proving title to such holding, and any other
information required by current rules and regulations.
With each list exhaustive information must also be provided on the personal and professional characteristics
of the candidates, and a declaration by the same candidates stating their possession of the requirements as per
law, regulations and the Corporate By-Laws, and their acceptance of their candidature.
Where, on expiry of the aforesaid term of 15 days, one single list has been submitted, or in any event in the
circumstances envisaged by current regulations, the Bank shall give prompt notice of this via at least two
press agencies; in this case, additional lists may be submitted up to the third day following the original expiry
date. In this event, the thresholds indicated below shall be reduced by half.
The election of the members of the Supervisory Board shall then proceed based on lists submitted:
a) directly by at least 500 Shareholders entitled to intervene and vote in the shareholders’ meeting called
to elect the Supervisory Board, who can provide evidence of such entitlement according to current
regulations, or by one or more shareholders that represent at least 0.50% of the company share capital,
whose limit is calculated with reference to the share capital existing 90 days prior to the date set for
the shareholders’ meeting, indicated in the notice of call;
b) by the outgoing Supervisory Board, on the proposal of the Appointments Committee and with the
votes of at least 17 Supervisory Board members, however supported, as set out in a) above, by at least 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
220
500 Shareholders entitled to intervene and vote in the shareholders’ meeting called to elect the
Supervisory Board, which provide evidence of such rights according to current regulations, or by one
or more shareholders that represent at least 0.50% of the company share capital, calculated with
reference to the share capital existing 90 days prior to the date set for the shareholders’ meeting,
indicated in the notice of call.
Each Shareholder may only be involved in the submission of one single list; in the case of a breach, the
signature of this shareholder shall not count for any list.
Each candidate may only be elected if included on one single list.
Lists submitted without complying with the above methods shall not to be considered.
Each Shareholder may vote for one single list.
The election of the members of the Supervisory Board shall proceed as follows:
a) in the event of the submission of multiple lists and regardless of the provisions of b) below, the 22
members of the Supervisory Board will be drawn from the list that obtains the majority of Shareholder
votes, in the order they appear on the list itself;
b) one member of the Supervisory Board shall be elected from the top of the list obtaining the second
greatest number of votes, if not connected pursuant to current regulations to the list referred to in letter
a) above. Where such list has obtained at least 15% of the votes cast at the shareholders’ meeting, in
addition to the one at the top of the list, a further 2 members, the second and third names, will be
elected to the Supervisory Board. Where such list has gained at least 30% of the votes cast at the
shareholders’ meeting, an additional 4 members, the second, third, fourth and fifth names on the list,
will instead be elected. Consequently, 20 or 18 members respectively of the Supervisory Board will be
elected, in the order they are listed on the list that obtained the majority of the votes cast by the
Shareholders.
c) where the minority list referred to in b) above contains the names of just two candidates, the third
director, and potentially the fourth and fifth in the event of obtaining at least 30% of the votes, will be
drawn from the majority list, from the highest names listed not yet elected.
In the event a single valid list is proposed, all 23 members will be drawn from this list if it obtains the
required majority at the ordinary shareholders’ meeting.
With regard to the appointment of those members of the Supervisory Board who for any reason are not able
to be elected using the procedures described above or where no list is submitted, the Shareholders’ meeting
shall resolve with a relative majority vote; where there are equal amounts of votes, the oldest candidate will
be appointed.
Where two or more lists obtain an equal number of votes, the same lists shall be voted on again, until an
unequal number of votes is obtained.
The offices of Chairman and Senior Deputy Chairman of the Board fall to the members indicated in first and
second place respectively on either list that obtains the majority of votes, the single list or to the members
appointed as such by the shareholders’ meeting, where no list is submitted.
Where, during the course of a trading period the Board comes to lack one or more members, the highest
candidate/s appearing on a majority list but not elected shall replace members/s originally elected from a
majority list; where there was no such list, the appointment shall be made by the shareholders’ meeting with
a relative majority vote without the need for lists, with the role of proposing candidates, where necessary,
falling to the Supervisory Board, on the proposal of the Appointments Committee.
In the event of the termination of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and/or the Senior Deputy Chairman
of the Supervisory Board, the ordinary shareholders’ meeting shall act to replace them without delay and
appoint the Chairman and/or the Senior Deputy Chairman, without in this case adopting the replacement 
Section One
221
mechanism described above, with the role of proposing candidates falling to the Supervisory Board, on the
proposal of the Appointments Committee.
Where instead it is necessary to replace members of the Supervisory Board belonging to a minority list, the
following procedure shall apply:
 in the case of a single member of the Supervisory Board having been appointed from the minority list,
the first candidate not elected from the same list the director being replaced was drawn, or failing this,
the candidate from any other minority lists with the greatest number of votes, shall be elected. Where
this is not possible, the shareholders’ meeting shall replace the member of the Supervisory Board
according to the principle of necessary representation of minorities;
 where the shareholders’ meeting appointed the additional 2 or 4 members of the Supervisory Board
drawn from the minority list, their replacements shall be drawn from the list where the member of the
Supervisory Board to be replaced was originally drawn from or, failing this, from another minority list
with the next highest number of votes and that obtained at least 15% or where applicable, 30% of the
votes expressed at the shareholders’ meeting; failing this, the members of the Supervisory Board to be
replaced will be drawn from the majority list, or failing this, the Shareholders’ meeting shall deliberate
on a relative majority vote;
 in the event that the 2 or 4 members of the Supervisory Board from the minority list had already been
replaced, according to the above procedure, by drawing them from the majority list or they were
appointed by the shareholders’ meeting with a relative majority in accordance with the above, to
replace the additional minority member of the Supervisory Board, the first candidate indicated on any
other minority list with the highest number of votes shall form the replacement; where this is not
possible, the shareholders’ meeting shall provide the replacement in accordance with the principle of
necessary representation of minorities.
The replacing candidates, as identified above, shall confirm their acceptance of the office together with
declarations that there are no causes for ineligibility or incompatibility, and of having the requirements of
current regulations or the Corporate By-Laws for the office.
The member of the Supervisory Board called as a replacement shall remain in office until the originally
anticipated termination of the replaced Director.

CHAPTER XXII – MATERIAL AGREEMENTS
This Chapter presents a summary of material agreements, other than those entered into during the normal
course of business, to which the Issuer or members of the Group are parties, for the two years immediately
preceding the Prospectus Date.
22.1 Reorganisation of interests held in Aviva Group Network Banks
On 29 December 2009, UBI Banca and Aviva S.p.A. signed an agreement for (i) the sale by Aviva S.p.A. to
UBI Banca of an approximately 4.75% interest in the capital of Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria for
an amount of approximately Euro 82 million (with a consequent reduction of Aviva S.p.A.’s interest in Banca
Popolare Commercio e Industria from 16.64% to approximately 11.89% in the latter’s share capital); (ii) the
sale by UBI Banca to Aviva S.p.A. of an approximately 6.5% interest in the capital of Banca Popolare di
Ancona for an amount of Euro 111 million; and (iii) the sale by Aviva S.p.A. to UBI Banca of an
approximately 7% interest in the capital of Banca Carime for an amount of approximately Euro 111 million
(with a consequent reduction of Aviva S.p.A.’s interest in Banca Carime from 14.15% to approximately
7.15% of the latter’s share capital). Note that, in connection with the sale of the interest in Banca Popolare di
Ancona, UBI Banca made contractual representations and warranties usual in transactions of this sort and
undertook the associated obligations of indemnification (limited to a maximum of 30% of the consideration
received for the sale).
22.2 Creation of a partnership in the non-life insurance sector with Fortis and BNP Paribas
Assurance
On 17 September, 2009, UBI Banca and Banca Popolare di Ancona, on the one part, and F&B Insurance
Holdings (a Belgian company in which Fortis holds an interest of 50% plus one share and BNP Paribas
Assurance 50% less one share), on the other part, signed a stock purchase and sale agreement for the
acquisition by F&B Insurance Holdings of 50% plus one share of UBI Assicurazioni.
The up-front consideration for the transaction was Euro 120 million, with an additional deferred component
(earn-out mechanism tied to the achievement of specific premium volumes) with a present value of
approximately Euro 40 million. The consideration also provides for a price adjustment mechanism tied to a
possible decrease in the number of bank branches owned by companies belonging to UBI Banca’s
distribution network during the term of the distribution agreement signed between UBI Banca and UBI
Assicurazioni on 29 December 2009.
In connection herewith, the parties also entered into a shareholders’ agreement dealing with UBI
Assicurazioni’s corporate governance as well as the rules governing circulation of the interests held by the
parties.
The partnership with Fortis and BNP Paribas Assurance has permitted the UBI Banca Group, inter alia, to
add to and diversify its product offerings in the non-life sector by distributing products characterised by a
high added value, thereby further expanding its commercial range into segments other than the motor one. It
has also enabled the Group to benefit from its partners’ industrial expertise in, among other things, product
innovation as well as to implement commercial strategies capable of maximising the potential afforded by
bundling and cross selling products for credit protection and in the non-life area, to be sold together with
banking products.
The transaction was completed on 29 December 2009 upon issuance of the appropriate authorisations.
22.3 Acquisition of entire capital of Barberini S.A. and Prestitalia S.p.A.
On 24 March 2010, UBI Banca signed two agreements with, respectively, the shareholders of Barberini S.A.
(a company of which it held 33.3% as of that date) for acquisition of the remaining 66.7% of the share
capital, and the shareholder agents of Prestitalia S.p.A. for acquisition of all shares held by them. Formal
commitments were entered into with the latter for exclusive distribution of “deduction of loan repayment
from salary” products and salary-backed loan products. 
Section One
227
Simultaneous with the signing of the purchase and sale agreement for 100% of Barberini S.A. and Prestitalia
S.p.A., a Euro 37 million capital increase of Prestitalia S.p.A. was subscribed, via Barberini S.A., in
implementation of the needed plan for capital reinforcement (as per Bank of Italy Order dated 3 March
2010).
The transaction, authorised by antitrust authorities on 19 May and by the Bank of Italy on 4 August, was
finalised on 9 September, 2010. In particular: (i) as regards Barberini S.A., UBI Banca acquired a total of
2,000,000 ordinary shares held by Medinvest International and Pharos S.A. (representing 66.67% of the
share capital that was being acquired) at a total price of Euro 7.3 million, along with 92,784 financial
instruments convertible into stock (called “parts bénéficiaires”) at a total price of Euro 341 thousand; (ii)
with reference to Prestitalia S.p.A., Barberini S.A. acquired 3,400 shares (equal to 6.4% of the share capital
remaining after the Euro 37 million capital increase entirely subscribed by UBI Banca in March) at a price of
Euro 3.6 million.
On 10 January 2011, Barberini S.A. sold its entire interest in Prestitalia S.p.A. (53,378 shares, corresponding
to 100% of the share capital) to B@nca 24-7 for a total price of Euro 77 million, determined on the basis of
an independent expert’s report.
22.4 Sale to RBC Dexia of custodian bank and correspondent bank businesses
On 28 September, 2009 UBI Banca, on the one part, and RBC Dexia Investor Services Limited and RBC
Dexia Investor Services Bank S.A. (collectively “RBC Dexia”) signed an agreement for: (i) the sale and
transfer to RBC Dexia of UBI Banca Group’s custodian bank activities (more than Euro 19 billion in assets
under administration, principally correlated to the management of mutual funds carried out by its subsidiary
UBI Pramerica); (ii) the transfer to RBC Dexia of its correspondent bank business, through the transfer of a
number of agreements with Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria for the provision of paying agent
services in Italy to Luxembourg SICAVs and Irish UCITS; (iii) RBC Dexia’s provision to UBI Banca of
custodial and settlement services for activities involving customer-owned and proprietary foreign securities.
The transaction was valued at Euro 93 million.
Note that UBI Banca gave no warranties to the buyer in connection with this transaction with regard to the
minimum level of assets under management included in the business line sold. The agreements provide for a
number of price adjustment mechanisms upon the occurrence of certain events – including cancellation and
the re-negotiation of the consideration amounts – relating to existing commercial relationships with UBI
Pramerica SGR S.p.A. coming within the scope of the business unit transferred and, notably, the depositary
bank agreement and the agreement outsourcing the provision of administrative services
In connection herewith, a ten-year agreement was also signed with RBC Dexia for the latter to provide
custodian banking services to UBI Pramerica on market terms
The transaction was finalised on 31 May 2010.
22.5 Partnership with Cattolica Assicurazioni in the life insurance sector
On 30 September, 2010 UBI Banca and Cattolica Assicurazioni agreed to renew their existing partnership in
the life insurance sector, set to expire at year end, until 31 December 2020. In connection herewith,
provisions were also made for insurance products of the joint venture Lombarda Vita S.p.A. to be exclusively
distributed by branches of the Network Banks of the former Banca Lombarda Group (Banco di Brescia,
Banca Regionale Europea, Banca di Valle Camonica, Banco di San Giorgio). In light hereof, and to further
reinforce the partnership, UBI Banca sold to Cattolica Assicurazioni an additional interest representing 9.9%
of the capital of the joint venture for a total consideration of Euro 118.3 million, Euro 60.9 million of which
(net of taxes) represented consolidated capital gains recorded as of September 30, 2010. Following these
extraordinary transactions, the capital of Lombarda Vita S.p.A. was thus 60% held by Cattolica Assicurazioni
(as compared to the prior 50.1%) and 40% by the UBI Banca Group (as compared to the prior 49.9%).

3.1 Declaration relating to working capital
Pursuant to Regulation 809/2004/EC and based on the definition of working capital – the means whereby the
Issuer obtains liquid funds needed to satisfy obligations coming due – contained in the “Recommendations
for uniform implementation of the European Commission’s Prospectus Directive” issued by the Committee
of European Securities Regulators (CESR), the Issuer believes that the working capital it has available is
sufficient to satisfy its current needs and those of the Group, meaning by such those relating to the 12 months
following the Prospectus Date.

3.3 Interests of individuals and corporate entities participating in the Global Offer
The Issuer is not aware of any significant interests by individuals and corporate entities in relation to the
Offer.
3.4 Reasons for the Offer and use of proceeds
The purpose of the Capital Increase is to further strengthen the UBI Banca Group’s capital position, with the
aim of supporting growth and enabling the Group to grasp the opportunities arising from future economic
growth.
Since its inception, the UBI Banca Group has always considered its capital strength to be one of the most
distinctive competitive factors in the national banking scene and has always positioned itself among the “best
in class” in terms of capital, taking into account the Group’s focus on the traditional deposit and lending
business and its low exposure to financial risks.
Specifically, the Capital Increase will allow the Group to strengthen its capital ratios, which as at 31
December 2010 came to 6.95%, in terms of Core Tier I Ratio, to 7.47%, in terms of Tier I Ratio, and to
11.17%, in terms of Total Capital Ratio. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
236
The increase in the capital ratios consequent upon the Capital Increase will allow the Group to anticipate the
alignment with the more stringent capital requirements for banks which are in the process of being
introduced in view of the coming into effect of Basel III, and to achieve a further improvement in the mix
and the quality of the Group’s capital by a further reinforcement of common equity as required by the new
regulations which will be progressively implemented.
In addition, via the Capital Increase the Group will equip itself with the financial resources necessary to
support growth as envisaged in the Industrial Plan. In this sense, the availability of adequate financial
resources should allow the Group to accentuate its competitiveness on the reference market, improve its
positioning and grasp the endogenous growth opportunities which will present themselves over the coming
years, all the while pursuing a sustainable dividend distribution policy.
Also, in the Issuer’s opinion, the Capital Increase should permit the Group to improve and strengthen the
ratings assigned by the international agencies with possible potential benefits in terms of funding costs.

237
CHAPTER IV – INFORMATION RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COVERED
BY THE OFFER / TO BE ADMITTED TO TRADING
4.1 Information relating to the UBI Shares
4.1.1 Description of the UBI Shares

currently in circulation, and will be issued with coupon no. 13 et seq..
The UBI Shares Option Rights are assigned ISIN code IT0004726615.
4.1.2 Laws under which the UBI Shares will be issued
The UBI Shares will be issued under Italian law.
4.1.3 Characteristics of the UBI Shares
The UBI Shares will be freely transferable registered shares with regular dividend entitlement as from the

sexies of the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) and related implementing regulations, and will be entered into
the centralised management system managed by Monte Titoli.
4.1.4 Currency of issue
The UBI Shares will be denominated in Euro.
4.1.5 Description of rights connected with the UBI Shares and procedure for their exercise
The UBI Shares will have the same characteristics and will grant the same administrative and economic
rights as the UBI shares outstanding on the date of their issuance.
UBI shares are admitted to listing on the MTA. The UBI Shares will be traded electronically, in accordance
with Article 2 (4) (1) of the Stock Exchange Regulations, on the same market as that on which UBI shares
are traded at the time of issue.
In particular, UBI shares are ordinary, registered, freely transferable and indivisible, and grant each
shareholder, whatever the number of UBI shares possessed, one single vote at the Issuer’s ordinary and
extraordinary shareholder meetings.
Reported below are some of provisions of the Corporate By-Laws relating to the acquisition of Shareholder
status and to the economic rights associated with UBI shares. The Corporate By-Laws are incorporated into
the Prospectus by reference, pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/71/EC and Article 28 of Regulation
809/2004/EC, and are available to the public at the registered office as well as on the website at
www.ubibanca.it.
Acquisition of Shareholder status
Pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the Corporate By-Laws, the status of Shareholder may be obtained by
individuals – excluding those under disqualification or disability, unrehabilitated bankrups and persons who
have had a conviction entailing a prohibition (including temporary) against holding public office – as well as
by corporate bodies and other collective entities, provided that they designate in writing the individual
authorised to represent them.
Pursuant to Article 8 of the Corporate By-Laws, anyone who intends to become a Shareholder must produce
for the Management Board a certificate of participation in the centralised management system and submit to
such Board a written request containing, in addition to an indication of the shares owned, his or her 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus

identifying particulars, domicile, citizenship, and all other information and/or statements due by law or under
the Corporate By-Laws or in general requested by the Company. For purposes of admission as a Shareholder,
a certification must be submitted, attesting to ownership of at least 250 shares.
The status of Shareholder is acquired, following the resolution of admittance, upon registration in the
Shareholder register.
A denial of admission as a Shareholder to anywhone who is regularly the owner of shares of the Company
has the sole effect of not allowing the exercise of rights other than economic rights.
Economic rights
Pursuant to Article 52 of the Corporate By-Laws, the net profit, less the legal reserve in the minimum
amount required by law and any percentages decided on by the shareholders’ meeting to form or add to
reserves, including extraordinary or other reserves, may, in keeping with principles of prudence, be directed
by the shareholders’ meeting, in a percentage not exceeding 1.5% of the distributable portion, to charitable,
humanitarian, social, cultural and artistic initiatives and institutions. The Management Board, after being
informed by its Chairman and after hearing his explanations, shall implement such decision, with due regard
for the guidelines and projects resolved upon by the Supervisory Board, taking particular account of the
Group’s territories of reference. The remaining portion shall be allocated as dividend to the shares, by
resolution of the shareholders’ meeting, which shall also decide on the appropriation of any excess.
The profit and valuation reserves formed in application of international accounting standards shall not be
distributable among Shareholders in the cases provided for by law. The Management Board may resolve
upon the distribution of an advance on the dividend during the financial year, in compliance with the rules
and regulations in force.
There are no categories of share other than ordinary shares.
4.1.6 Resolutions and authorisations
On 30 April, 2011, the Issuer’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting resolved, inter alia, as follows:
i. to authorise, pursuant to Article 2443 of the Italian Civil Code, the Management Board, subject to the
authorisation of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital by payment in cash, in one or
more issues, within 12 months from the date of the resolution, by a total maximum amount of Euro 1
billion, inclusive of any share premium, through the issuance of ordinary shares having the same
characteristics as those outstanding, to be offered for payment in cash to the shareholders and the
holders of the convertible bond “UBI 2009/2013 convertibile con facoltà di rimborso in azioni”, with
the broadest powers for the Management Board to set, from time to time and in observance of the
above limitations, the procedures, the terms and the conditions of the operation, including the issue
price of the new shares (including any share premium) and dividend entitlement, specifying that in the
calculation of the issue price of the shares, including the share premium, the Management Board shall
take into account, inter alia, the market conditions prevailing at the time of the launch of the
transaction, the stock market price of the UBI ordinary share, the operating performance, capital and
financial position of the Bank and the Group which it leads as well as market practices for similar
transactions.
ii. to grant the Management Board, and through it the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer – also acting severally, within the limits set by law – the broadest powers to take all steps
necessary to implement the resolutions passed by the shareholders’ meeting, and to carry out all
formalities needed for all resolutions adopted to obtain legal approval and, in general, to perform all
activities necessary for the complete execution of such resolutions, with any and all powers needed for
that purpose, none being excluded, including the power to make such non-essential amendments to the
resolutions passed as are required for registration in the Company Registry, including those in relation
to any instructions from regulators. 
Section Two
239
On 13 May 2011, the Issuer’s Management Board, in implementation of the authorisation granted to it,
resolved, after obtaining a favourable opinion from the Supervisory Board, inter alia:
- to increase the share capital by a maximum amount of Euro 1 billion, including any share premium,
through the issue, against payment in cash, of ordinary shares with the same characteristics as those
currently outstanding and regular dividend entitlement, to be offered under option to the Company’s
shareholders and holders of the Convertible Bonds, on the basis of the conversion ratio specified in
Article 5 of the Convertible Bond Regulations;
- to establish that if, by the final deadline of 31 December 2011, the Capital Increase has not been fully
subscribed, the share capital is to be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to subscriptions
gathered by that date;
- to determine, at a future meeting of the Management Board to be called in the days immediately
preceding the launch of the Offer,, subject to authorisation of the Supervisory Board, and in the forms
indicated in Article 2443 of the Italian Civil Code, i) the per-share issue price of UBI Shares including
share premium, which is to be determined taking into account, among other things, prevailing market
conditions at the time the transaction is actually launched; market prices for ordinary UBI shares; the
income, operating, financial position and financial performance of the Company and its affiliated
Group, and the market practices for similar transactions; ii) the number of UBI Shares to be issued and
the final amount of the Capital Increase; iii) the option allocation ratio to be used for offering UBI
Shares to shareholders and holders of the Convertible Bonds; and iv) any other characteristic of the
Capital Increase which was not finalised in the meeting on 13 May 2011.
On 1 June 2011, the Management Board, after obtaining a favourable opinion from the Supervisory Board,
therefore resolved to: (i) increase the share capital, in one or more issues, by a total maximum amount of
Euro 999,908,234.75, Euro 656,452,360 of which is to be allocated to share capital and Euro 343,455,874.75
to the share premium reserve, through the issuance of a maximum of 262,580,944 UBI Shares and (ii) to set
the option ratio at 8 UBI Shares for every 21 UBI shares and/or Convertible Bonds held.
Adjustments to financial instruments issued by UBI
As regards the UBI Banca warrants, Warrant azioni ordinarie UBI Banca 2009/2011 (the “Warrants”) –
ISIN code IT 0004495187 – Article 7 of the Warrant Regulations provides that, if transactions on UBI
Banca’s share capital are resolved upon and implemented between the issue date of the Warrants and the date
on which the Conversion shares are made available to the Warrant holders (for this purpose taking into
account Article 5), the Exercise Ratio and the Exercise Price, as defined in Article 2 of the Warrant
Regulations, may be adjusted by UBI Banca.
In particular, in the event of share capital increases against payment in cash, to be implemented through the
issue of new shares to be offered under option to the assignees, or of other transactions that give rise to a
negotiable right, the Exercise Price of each Warrant will be decreased by an amount, expressed in Euros and
rounded to the nearest third decimal point, equal to:
(Pcum - Pex) × 20 × Exercise Ratio
where:
- “Pcum” indicates the simple arithmetic mean of the last three official prices “cum rights” of the
Bank’s ordinary shares recorded on the MTA;
- “Pex” indicates the ratio between: i) the sum of the number of shares on the market prior to the capital
increase multiplied by Pcum and the new shares issued multiplied by the issue price of the new shares
and ii) the total number of shares outstanding after the capital increase.
In no case may the Exercise Price be increased as a result of application of the preceding formula (even if
Pex is greater than Pcum). 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
240
In the same way, in no case may the Exercise Price, as redetermined based on the preceding formula, be
lower than the par value of the Conversion Share, as modified from time to time and excepting the case in
which, as a result of an amendment to UBI Banca’s Corporate By-Laws, the par value of the shares is not
indicated in accordance with Article 2346 (3) of the Italian Civil Code.
Any communication to the Warrant holders shall be made through a public notice published in at least one
national newspaper and on the web site www.ubibanca.it, pursuant to Article 10 of the Warrant Regulations.
4.1.7 Issue date of the UBI Shares
The UBI Shares subscribed by the end of the Offer shall be credited to the accounts of intermediaries
belonging to the centralised management system managed by Monte Titoli at the close of the accounting day
on the last day of the Offer Period, and shall thus be available from the next settlement date.
The UBI Shares subscribed by the end of the Market Offer shall be credited to the accounts of intermediaries
belonging to the centralised management system managed by Monte Titoli at the close of the accounting day
on the last day for exercising the option rights, and shall thus be available from the next settlement date.
4.1.8 Possible restrictions on the free circulation of the UBI Shares
There are no limitations on the free transferability of the UBI Shares pursuant to legislation, the Corporate
By-Laws or deriving from the terms of the issue.
4.1.9 Tender offers and/or remaining offers
From the time the UBI Shares are subscribed, they shall be subject to the rules set out in the Consolidated
Finance Act (TUF) and related implementing regulations, including the Issuer Regulations, dealing with
listed financial instruments traded on regulated Italian markets, with particular reference to the rules issued
in relation to mandatory tender offers (TUF Article 106), sell-outs (TUF Article 108) and squeeze-outs (TUF
Article 111).
4.1.10 Tender offers for shares of the Issuer in the preceding and current fiscal years
During the preceding financial year and the financial year in course, no public tender offers have been made
for the acquisition or exchange of the UBI Shares.
Here it should be noted that, on 27 October, 2010, following the signing of a shareholders’ agreement
between UBI Banca and Webstar S.A. in connection with the larger project to integrate the business of IW
Bank with that of Twice SIM S.p.A. (see Section One, Chapter V, Paragraph 5.1.5), UBI Banca and Webstar
S.A. notified the market that the threshold of 90% of the voting share capital of IW Bank had been exceeded,
that they did not intend to re-establish IW Bank’s free float and that they consequently intended to fulfil the
obligation to purchase the remaining shares of IW Bank pursuant to the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF)
Article 108 (2). The obligation to purchase the shares of IW Bank was carried out by UBI Banca, also on
behalf of Webstar S.A..
The procedure was concluded on 19 April, 2011, on which date UBI Banca, invoking the squeeze-out right
under Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) Article 111 (1), proceeded to formally notify IW Bank, pursuant to
and for purposes of Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) Article 111 (3), that it had deposited the purchase price
for each IW Bank share, equal to Euro 2.043, with Centrobanca, which acted as an intermediary coordinating
collection of the tenders for sale via the MTA. Effective as of such date, the MTA listing of the ordinary
shares of IW Bank was revoked.
4.1.11 Taxation
The information reported below summarises the tax regime applicable to the purchase, holding and sale of
the Issuer’s shares under current Italian tax laws and in relation to specific categories of investors.
What follows is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the tax consequences of buying, holding and
selling shares. 
Section Two
241
The tax regime applicable to the purchase, holding and sale of shares, presented below, is based on the laws
in effect and practice existing as of the Prospectus Date. It is understood that these remain subject to possible
changes, including with retroactive effect. Hence, what follows is merely an introduction to the topic.
Investors are thus required to consult with their own advisors regarding the tax regime applicable to the
purchase, holding and sale of shares and to verify the nature and origin of the amounts received as
distributions on the Issuer’s shares (dividends or reserves).
A) Definitions
For purposes of this Paragraph 4.1.11, the terms defined have the meaning indicated below.
“Sale of Qualified Equity Interests”: sale of shares other than savings shares, rights or securities by which
shares may be acquired that, over a period of twelve months, exceed the limits for classification as a
Qualified Equity Interest. For purposes of verifying the qualification limits of sales over the course of the
twelve months, the relevant sales are those made from the time when the rights and securities possessed
represent a percentage of voting or participation rights greater than the aforesaid limits. For rights or
securities by which shares may be acquired, account is taken of the percentages of voting rights or
participation in the capital that are potentially referable to the equity interests;
“Non-Qualified Equity Interests”: equity interests in companies listed on regulated markets other than
Qualified Equity Interests;
“Qualified Equity Interests”: equity interests in companies listed on regulated markets consisting of the
possession of equity interests (other than savings shares), rights or securities by which the aforesaid equity
interest may be acquired, that represent an overall percentage of voting rights exercisable at ordinary
shareholders’ meetings greater than 2%, or an interest in capital or equity greater than 5%.
B) Taxation of dividends
Dividends on the Issuer’s shares will be subject to the regular tax treatment applicable to dividends paid by
stock corporations resident in Italy for tax purposes.
The following different types of taxation are provided for the different categories of payee.
(i) Individuals with tax residence in Italy and not engaged in business
Dividends paid to individuals with their tax residence in Italy on shares held other than as part of the
operation of a business and constituting Non-Qualified Equity Interests, entered into the centralised deposit
system managed by Monte Titoli (such as the UBI Shares), are subject to substitute tax at a rate of 12.50%,
with mandatory deduction, pursuant to Article 27 ter of Presidential Decree no. 600 of 19 September, 1973
(“DPR 600/1973”); payees have no obligation to report the dividends received in their income tax
declarations.
This substitute tax is applied by the resident parties with which the securities have been deposited that belong
to the centralised deposit system managed by Monte Titoli, and, through a tax agent appointed in Italy (in
particular, a bank or securities brokerage firm resident in Italy, a permanent establishment of non-resident
banks or investment companies, or a firm providing centralised management of financial instruments
authorised under TUF Article 80), by non-resident parties (depositories) who are part of the Monte Titoli
System or of foreign centralised deposit systems that belong to Monte Titoli System.
Further to the enforcement of Legislative Decree no. 213 of 24 June 1998 on the holding of securities in
dematerialised regime, this mode of taxation constitutes the regime ordinarily applicable to shares traded on
Italian regulated markets, such as the UBI Shares.
Dividends paid to individuals with their tax residence in Italy on shares held other than in the operation of a
business and constituting Qualified Equity Interests are not subject to any source withholding or substitute
tax provided that the entitled payees, at the time payment is received, declare that the profits received relate
to equity interests in connection with Qualified Equity Interests.

242
Such dividends contribute in part towards the formation of the shareholder’s total taxable income. The 2
April 2008 Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance (the “2 April, 2008 MD”) – in implementation
of Article 1 (38) of Law no. 244 of 24 December 2007 (the “2008 Finance Act”) – re-set at 49.72% the
percentage contributing towards the formation of income. This percentage is applied to dividends formed of
profits produced by the Company beginning with the financial year subsequent to the one in progress on 31
December 2007. This is without prejudice to the application of the preceding percentage of contribution
towards the formation of income, 40%, for profits produced up to the financial year in progress on 31
December 2007. Furthermore, starting with the distribution resolutions after the one dealing with the profit
for the financial year in progress on 31 December 2007, for purposes of taxation of the payee, the dividends
distributed shall first be deemed to be formed of profits produced by the Company up to that date.
In any event, if the dividends refer to shares for which the individual has opted for the so-called “managed
savings” regime under Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 461 of 21 November, 1997, they are not subject to
the regime described above but contribute towards the formation of total income for the year, to which 12.5%
substitute tax is applied.
(ii) Individuals with tax residence in Italy and engaged in business
Dividends paid to individuals with their tax residence in Italy on shares relating to the business are not
subject to any source withholding or substitute tax provided that the entitled payees, at the time payment is
received, declare that the profits received are in relation to business-related equity interests. Such dividends
contribute in part towards the formation of the shareholder’s total taxable income. The 2 April 2008
Ministerial Decree – in implementation of Article 1 (38) of the 2008 Finance Act – re-set at 49.72% the
percentage contributing towards the formation of income. This percentage is applied to dividends formed of
profits produced by the Company beginning with the financial year subsequent to the one in progress on 31
December 2007. This is without prejudice to the application of the preceding percentage of contribution
towards the formation of income, 40%, for profits produced up to the financial year in progress on 31
December 2007. Furthermore, starting with the distribution resolutions following that dealing with the profit
for the financial year in progress on 31 December 2007, for purposes of taxation of the payee, the dividends
distributed shall first be deemed to be formed of profits produced by the Company up to that date.
(iii) Partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as such under Article 5 of Presidential
Decree no. 917 of 22 December 1986 (hereinafter the Italian Income Tax Code “TUIR”), companies
and entities referred to in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b) with their tax residence in Italy
Dividends received by partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as such (excluding simple
partnerships (società semplici)), as indicated in TUIR Article 5, by companies and entities as indicated in
TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b), or by stock corporations, limited partnerships with shares, limited liability
companies, public and private entities the sole or primary objective of which is the carrying on of
commercial activities (so-called “commercial entities”) with their tax residence in Italy are not subject to any
source withholding in Italy and contribute to the payee’s total taxable income as follows:
- distributions to partnerships and limited partnerships contribute in part to the formation of the
shareholder’s total taxable income; the 2 April 2008 MD – in implementation of Article 1 (38) of the
2008 Finance Act – re-set at 49.72% the percentage contributing towards the formation of income of
individuals. This percentage is applied to dividends formed of profits produced by the Company
beginning with the financial year subsequent to the one in progress on 31 December 2007. This is
without prejudice to the application of the preceding percentage of contribution towards the formation
of income, 40%, for profits produced up to the fiscal year in progress on 31 December 2007.
Furthermore, starting with the distribution resolutions following that dealing with the profit for the
financial year in progress on 31 December 2007, for purposes of taxation of the payee, the dividends
distributed shall first be deemed to be formed of profits produced by the Company up to that date.
- distributions to stock corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships with shares and
commercial entities contribute to forming the payee’s total taxable income limited to 5% of their
amount, or for the entire amount if in relation to securities held for trading by parties applying
IAS/IFRS international accounting standards. 
Section Two
243
(iv) Entities indicated in TUIR Article 73 (1) (c) with their tax residence in Italy
Dividends received by the entities indicated in TUIR Article 73 (1) (c), or by public and private entities with
their tax residence in Italy other than companies the sole or primary objective of which is not the carrying on
of commercial activities, contribute towards the formation of total income limited to 5% of their amount.
(v) Exempt parties
For shares such as the UBI Shares entered into the centralised deposit system managed by Monte Titoli,
dividends received by resident parties exempt from corporate income tax (IRES) are subject to substitute tax
at a rate of 27% applied by the party (a member of the centralised deposit system managed by Monte Titoli)
with which the UBI Shares are deposited.
(vi) Italian pension funds and UCITS
Profits received by (a) Italian pension funds as indicated in Legislative Decree no. 252 of 5 December 2005
(“Decree 252”) and (b) Italian undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities subject to the
regulations contained in Article 8 (1) - (4) of Legislative Decree no. 461 of 21 November, 1997 (“UCITS”)
are not subject either to source withholding or to substitute tax.
They contribute towards the formation of the total accrued operating results for the year, subject to substitute
tax at a rate of 11% for pension funds and 12.50% for UCITS.
Note, however, that starting 1 July 2011, a new regime for UCITS taxation will go into effect, under which –
instead of the substitute tax referred to at the rate of 12.5% of total accrued operating results for the year – a
12.5% withholding at source will be applied at the time of any distribution of income, or on the difference
between the redemption or liquidation value of the units and the cost of subscribing or acquiring the same.
Such withholding shall represent either a partial payment or a tax depending on the legal nature of the
subscriber of the related units.
(vii) Real estate mutual funds
Pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 351 of 25 September, 2001 (“Decree 351”), converted into law, as
amended by Law no. 410 of 23 November, 2001 and as a result of the amendments made by Article 41-bis of
Legislative Decree no. 269 of 30 September, 2003 (“Decree 269”), converted into law, as amended by Law
no. 326 of November 24, 2003, dividends received by real estate mutual funds set up pursuant to the
Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) Article 37 or Article 14-bis of Law no. 86 of 25 January 1994 (“Law 86”),
as well as by real estate funds set up prior to 26 September, 2001, are not subject either to withholding tax or
to substitute tax. Income deriving from holdings of such funds are generally subject to a 20% withholding at
source.
(viii) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy which hold UBI Shares through a permanent
establishment located in Italy
Profit distributions received by parties not resident in Italy which hold their interest through a permanent
establishment in Italy are not subject to any withholding in Italy or to a substitute tax. They contribute
towards the formation of the permanent establishment’s total income to the extent of 5% of their amount, or
for the entire amount if in relation to securities held for trading by parties applying IAS/IFRS international
accounting standards.
If the distributions are traceable to an equity interest unconnected with a permanent establishment in Italy of
the non-resident payee, please refer to the following paragraph.
(ix) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy which do not hold UBI Shares through a permanent
establishment located in Italy
Dividends deriving from shares or securities entered into the centralised deposit system managed by Monte
Titoli (such as the UBI Shares) received by parties not having their tax residence in Italy and without a
permanent establishment located in Italy to which the equity interest is referable are, as a general rule, 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
244
subject to a 27% substitute tax, reduced to 12.50% for profits paid on savings shares, pursuant to Article 27
ter of Presidential Decree 600/1973.
This substitute tax is applied by the resident parties with which the securities have been deposited that belong
to the centralised deposit system managed by Monte Titoli, and, through a tax agent appointed in Italy (in
particular, a bank or securities brokerage firm resident in Italy, a permanent establishment of non-resident
banks or investment companies, or a firm providing centralised management of financial instruments
authorised under Article 80 of the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF)), by non-resident parties (depositories)
who are part of the Monte Titoli System or of foreign centralised deposit systems that belong to the Monte
Titoli System.
Shareholders not having their tax residence in Italy, other than savings shareholders, have the right, upon
submitting a refund request under the conditions and within the time limits required by law, to
reimbursement, up to the amount of 4/9 of the substitute tax to which they were subjected in Italy within the
meaning of Article 27-ter, of the tax which they demonstrate they definitively paid abroad on the same
profits, upon producing the related certification of the tax office of the foreign State to the appropriate Italian
tax authorities.
As an alternative to the aforesaid refund, parties resident in States with which a double taxation convention is
in effect may request application of the substitute tax replacing the income tax to the (reduced) extent
provided by the convention in effect from time to time. To that end, the parties with which the shares are
deposited and which belong to the centralised deposit system managed by Monte Titoli are to obtain:
- a declaration by the non-resident party which is the actual beneficiary of the profits, showing the
identifying details of such party, the existence of all conditions on which application of the tax
convention regime is dependent, and any elements necessary for determining the rate applicable under
the convention;
- a certification by the appropriate tax authority of the State of which the actual beneficiary of the profits
is a resident, showing residence in such State within the meaning of the convention. This certification
shall be effective until 31 March of the year following its submission.
If such documentation is not presented to the depositary prior to the payment of the dividends, the substitute
tax shall be applied at a rate of 27%. In that event, however, the actual beneficiary of the dividends may
request reimbursement from the Italian tax authorities of the difference between the withholding applied and
that applicable pursuant to the convention, by an appropriate refund request accompanied by the above
documentation, to be presented under the conditions and within the time limits required by law.
In the event that the payees are (i) resident for tax purposes in one of the Member States of the European
Union or in one of the States party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and included on the list
to be made available by an appropriate Decree of the Ministry of Economics and Finance pursuant to TUIR
Article 168 bis and (ii) subject to a corporate income tax, the dividends are subject to a substitute tax equal to
1.375% of the related amount. Until the aforesaid Decree has been issued by the Ministry of Economics and
Finance, the States party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area which are relevant for purposes
of application of the cited 1.375% tax are those included in the list indicated in the Decree of the Ministry of
Economics and Finance of 4 September, 1996, as subsequently amended. For purposes of Article 1 (68) of
the 2008 Finance Act, the 1.375% substitute tax is applied only to dividends deriving from profits formed
beginning with the fiscal year following the one in progress on 31 December 2007.
Pursuant to Article 27 bis of Presidential Decree 600/1973, approved in implementation of Directive no.
435/90/EEC of 23 July 1990, in the event that dividends are received by a company (a) that takes one of the
forms indicated in the annexe to said Directive no. 435/90/EEC, (b) which has its tax residence in a Member
State of the European Union, (c) which is subject, in its State of residence, with no ability to benefit from
optional or exemption regimes other than those subject to temporal or territorial limits, to one of the taxes
indicated in the annexe to the aforesaid Directive and (d) which holds a direct share of the Issuer of no less
than 10 percent of the share capital, for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, such company has the
right to seek from the Italian financial authorities reimbursement of the substitute tax applied to the
dividends received by it. To that end, the non-resident company shall produce a certification from the 
Section Two
245
appropriate tax authorities of the foreign State attesting that the non-resident company satisfies the aforesaid
requirement as well as documentation attesting to the existence of the conditions indicated above.
Furthermore, in accordance with the clarifications given by the Italian tax authorities, upon the meeting of
the aforesaid conditions and, alternatively, upon the submission of a refund request subsequent to the
distribution of the dividend, provided that the minimal annual holding period for the interest in the Issuer has
already elapsed at the time of distribution of such dividend, the non-resident company may directly request
the intermediary with which the UBI Shares are deposited not to apply the substitute tax by submitting the
same documentation as indicated above to the intermediary in question. In relation to non-resident
companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by parties not resident in Member States of the European
Union, the aforesaid regime for reimbursement or non-application of the substitute tax may be invoked only
on the condition that such companies demonstrate that they were not set up for the exclusive or primary
purpose of the regime in question.
(x) Distribution of reserves pursuant to TUIR Article 47 (5)
The information provided in this paragraph summarises the tax regime applicable to the distribution by the
Issuer – other than upon a reduction of excess capital, withdrawal, exclusion, redemption or liquidation – of
the capital reserves indicated in TUIR Article 47 (5) or, among others, of reserves or other funds constituted
with share premiums, with adjustment interest paid by subscribers, with sink fund or capital account
contributions made by shareholders, and with tax-exempt currency revaluation balances (hereinafter also
referred to as “Capital Reserves”).
(a) Individuals with tax residence in Italy and not engaged in business
Regardless of the shareholders’ resolution, amounts received by individuals with their tax residence in Italy
not engaged in a business, which represent a distribution of capital reserves constitute profits for the payees
within the limits and insofar as, on the part of the distributing company, operating income and revenue
reserves exist (except for the portion thereof set aside on a tax-deferred basis) for the company making the
payout. The amounts classified as profits are subject to the same regime as indicated above, depending on
whether or not what is involved are non-qualified equity interests and/or interests not related to the company
The amounts received as a distribution of Capital Reserves, net (based on what was just now indicated) of
any amount classifiable as profit, shall reduce the cost basis of the equity interest for tax purposes by an
equal amount. It follows that, upon a subsequent sale, the taxable capital gain is calculated as the difference
between the selling price and the cost basis of the equity interest for tax purposes, less an amount equal to the
sums received as distributions of capital reserves (net of any amount classifiable as profit). Under the
interpretation made by the Italian tax authorities, sums received that represent distributions of Capital
Reserves, for the portion exceeding the tax basis of the equity interest, constitute profits. In relation to equity
interests for which the individual has opted for the so-called “managed savings” regime indicated in Article 7
of Legislative Decree 461/1997, in the absence of any clarification by the Italian tax authorities, interpreting
the rules systematically would indicate that the sums distributed that represent distributions of Capital
Reserves ought to contribute towards forming the total accrued operating results for the year for the tax
period in which the distribution took place. Likewise, the value of the equity interests at the end of the same
tax period (or upon the cessation of the “managed savings” regime, whichever is earlier) must be included in
calculating the total operating results for the year accrued during the tax period, to be subjected to substitute
tax at a rate of 12.50%.
(b) Partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as such under TUIR Article 5, companies and
entities indicated in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b) and individuals resident for tax purposes in Italy and
engaged in business
For individuals carrying on business activities, partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as
such (excluding simple partnerships) as indicated in TUIR Article 5, for the companies and entities indicated
in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b) resident for tax purposes in Italy, amounts received as distributions from
Capital Reserves constitute profits within the limits and insofar as, on the part of the distributing company,
operating income and revenue reserves exist (except for the portion thereof set aside on a tax-deferred basis)
for the company making the payout. The amounts classified as profits ought to be subject to the same regime
as that presented above. Amounts received that represent distributions of Capital Reserves, net of any amount
classifiable as profits, reduce the recognised tax basis of the equity interest by an equal amount. Amounts 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
246
received as distributions of Capital Reserves, for the portion exceeding the tax basis of the equity interest,
constitute capital gains and, as such, are subject to the regime discussed in paragraph C below.
(c) Italian pension funds and UCITS (investment funds, variable capital investment companies (SICAVs))
Under a systematic interpretation of the rules, amounts received from UCITS (investment funds, SICAVs)
and Italian pension funds as indicated in Decree 252 that represent distributions of Capital Reserves ought to
contribute towards forming the total accrued operating results for the period in which the distribution took
place, subject to a substitute tax of 12.50% (for pension funds: 11%). Likewise, the value of the equity
interests at the end of the same tax period must be included when calculating the operating results for the
year.
Note, however, that starting 1 July 2011, a new regime for UCITS taxation will come into effect, under
which – instead of the substitute tax referred to at the rate of 12.5% of total accrued operating results for the
year – a 12.5% source withholding will be applied at the time of any distribution of income, or on the
difference between the redemption or liquidation value of the units and the cost of subscribing or acquiring
the same. Such withholding shall represent either a partial payment or a tax depending on the legal nature of
the subscriber of the related units.
(d) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy and lacking a permanent establishment in the country
For parties not having their tax residence in Italy (whether individuals or corporations) and lacking a
permanent establishment in Italy to which the equity interest may be referred, the tax nature of the sums
received representing distributions of Capital Reserves is the same as that noted for individuals resident in
Italy for tax purposes. As with what is stated for individuals and corporations having their tax residence in
Italy, amounts received representing distributions of Capital Reserves, net of any amount classifiable as
profits, reduce the recognised tax basis of the equity interest by an equal amount.
(e) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy and possessing a permanent establishment there
With regard to non-resident parties that hold their equity interest through a permanent establishment in Italy,
such amounts contribute towards forming the permanent establishment’s income, in accordance with the tax
regime provided for the companies and entities referred to in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b) with their tax
residence in Italy.
If a distribution of Capital Reserves originates with an equity interest unconnected with a permanent
establishment of the non-resident payee in Italy, refer to Paragraph (d), supra.
C. Tax regime applicable to capital gains deriving from stock sales
(i) Individuals having their tax residence in Italy and not engaged in business
Capital gains, other than those obtained in carrying on commercial businesses, realised by individuals having
their tax residence in Italy through the sale for valuable consideration of equity interests in companies, as
well as of rights or securities whereby the aforesaid interests may be obtained, are subject to a different tax
regime depending on whether they involve a sale of Qualified Equity Interests or of Non-Qualified Equity
Interests.
Sale of Qualified Equity Interests
Capital gains originating on the sale of a Qualified Equity Interest which were obtained other than in the
conduct of a commercial business by individuals having their tax residence in Italy contribute in a partial
amount towards the formation of the payee’s taxable income. The 2 April 2008 MD – in implementation of
Article 1 (38) of the 2008 Finance Act – re-set at 49.72% the percentage contributing towards the formation
of income. This percentage applies to capital gains realised on or after 1 January 2009. This is without
prejudice to the preceding percentage contributed towards the formation of income, 40%, for capital gains
relating to acts of realisation carried out prior to 1 January 2009 but the proceeds of which are received in
whole or in part on or after such date. For such capital gains, taxation occurs when the annual declaration of
income is made. 
Section Two
247
Non-Qualified Equity Interests
Capital gains not obtained in the conduct of a commercial business realised by individuals having their tax
residence in Italy through a sale for valuable consideration of Non-Qualified Equity Interests, as well as of
rights or securities whereby the aforesaid interests may be obtained, are subject to a 12.5% substitute tax.
The taxpayer may opt for one of the following methods of taxation:
(a) Taxation based on the income declaration. The declaration is to indicate the capital gains and capital
losses realised during the year. The 12.5% substitute tax is determined at that time on the capital gains
minus the related capital losses, and is paid within the time periods provided for income taxes owed
for the balance shown on the declaration. Provided they are reported on the income declaration, excess
capital losses may be deducted up to the amount of the related capital gains for subsequent tax periods,
but not beyond the fourth such period. The declaration method is obligatory if the party does not
choose either of the two regimes indicated in points (b) and (c) below;
(b) Administered savings regime (optional). This regime may apply provided that (i) the UBI Shares are
deposited at resident banks or securities brokerage firms or other resident parties specified by
appropriate ministerial decrees and (ii) the shareholder, by signed written communication sent to the
intermediary, opts for application of the administered savings regime. Should the party opt for such
regime, the substitute tax at a rate of 12.5% shall be determined and paid at the time of the individual
sale by the intermediary by which the shares are held in custody or under administration, on each
capital gain realised. Any capital losses may be offset in connection with the same relationship by
deducting the amount of the capital losses up to the amount of the capital gains realised in subsequent
transactions engaged in during the same or in subsequent tax periods, but not beyond the fourth such
period. If the custody or administration should cease, any capital losses may be deducted – but not
beyond the fourth tax period subsequent to the period of realisation – from capital gains realised in
connection with another administered savings relationship registered to the same parties as the original
relationship or custodial deposit, or may be deducted when the income declaration is made;
(c) Managed savings regime (optional). The prerequisite for choosing this regime is the engagement of an
authorised intermediary as asset manager. Under this regime, a 12.5% substitute tax is applied by the
intermediary at the end of each tax period on the increase in value of the managed assets accruing
during the tax period, even if not received, less any income subject to withholding, exempt or
otherwise non-taxable income, income that contributes towards forming the taxpayer’s total income,
and revenues deriving from units of Italian undertakings for collective investment in transferable
securities as described in Article 8 of Legislative Decree 461/1997. Under the managed savings
regime, capital gains realised through the sale of Non-Qualified Equity Interests contribute towards
forming the incremental value of the managed assets accruing during the tax period, subject to a
12.5% substitute tax. A negative result of asset management obtained during a tax period may be
deducted from the results of management for the following four tax periods, for the entire amount
contained by each. Should the management relationship be ended, the accrued negative results of asset
management (shown on appropriate certification issued by the manager) may be deducted – not
beyond the fourth tax period subsequent to that in which they accrued – from capital gains realised in
connection with another relationship to which the administered savings regime is applicable, or
utilised (up to the amount it contains) in connection with another relationship for which the managed
savings regime was chosen, provided that the relationship or custodial deposit in question is registered
to the same parties as those to whom the original relationship or custodial deposit was registered, or
may be deducted by the same parties when making their income declaration, in accordance with the
same rules applicable to excess capital losses as those in the preceding point (a).
(ii) Individuals engaged in business, partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as such
under TUIR Article 5
Capital gains realised by individuals in the conduct of a business, by partnerships, limited partnerships and
companies treated as such under TUIR Article 5, through a sale of shares for valuable consideration
contribute in their full amount towards forming taxable business income, subject to taxation in Italy under
the ordinary regime. 
Unione di Banche Italiane S.c.p.a. – Prospectus
248
As clarified by tax authorities, negative income amounts realised by individuals engaged in business,
partnerships, limited partnerships and companies treated as such under TUIR Article 5 through a sale of UBI
Shares for valuable consideration will be fully deductible from the seller’s taxable income.
However, if the conditions indicated in points (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the following paragraph are satisfied,
only a portion of the capital gains will contribute towards forming taxable business income. The 2 April 2008
Ministerial Decree – in implementation of Article 1 (38) of the 2008 Finance Act – re-set at 49.72% the
percentage contributing towards the formation of income. This percentage is applied to capital gains realised
on or after 1 January 2009.
Capital losses realised in relation to equity interests meeting the requirements contained in points (a), (b), (c)
and (d) of the following paragraph are deductible in part, analogous to the provisions relating to the taxation
of capital gains.
The tax basis of the shares sold, less any write-downs made in prior tax periods, is used for determining the
capital gains and losses relevant for tax purposes.
(iii) Companies and entities referred to in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b)
Capital gains realised by the companies and entities referred to in TUIR Article 73 (1) (a) - (b), or by stock
corporations, limited partnerships with shares, limited liability companies and public or private entities with
the sole or primary objective of carrying on commercial activities, through the sale of UBI Banca Shares for
valuable consideration, contribute towards forming taxable business income in their full amount.
However, pursuant to TUIR Article 87, capital gains realised on shares of companies and entities indicated in
TUIR Article 73 do not contribute towards the formation of taxable income, inasmuch as being exempt to the
extent of 95%, if the aforesaid shares meet the following requirements:
(a) uninterrupted holding from the first day of the twelfth month preceding that in which the sale took
place, with the shares most recently acquired being treated as first sold;
(b) classification as financial fixed assets in the financial position statement for the first period closed
during the holding period;
(c) investee company’s tax residence in a State or territory indicated in the decree of the Minister of
Economy and Finance issued under TUIR Article 168 bis or, alternatively, demonstration (following
the year in which a request for a ruling was made under TUIR Article 167 (5) (b) that, since the start of
the holding period, the equity interests did not have the effect of allocating income in States or
territories other than those specified in the same decree as indicated in TUIR Article 168 bis;
(d) the investee company is engaged in a commercial business as defined by TUIR Article 55; however,
this requirement is not relevant for equity interests in companies whose securities are traded on
regulated markets.
The requirements indicated in points (c) and (d) must be present without interruption at the time the capital
gains are realised, at least from the start of the third tax period prior to such realisation. Sales of stocks
belonging to the category “financial fixed assets” and those belonging to the category “current assets” are to
be considered separately for each category. When the requirements mentioned are present, capital losses
realised upon the sale of equity interests are not deductible from business income.
The cost of the shares sold, less any write-downs made in prior tax periods, is used in determining the capital
gains and losses relevant for tax purposes.
Beginning 1 January 2006, capital losses and negative differences between the proceeds and the costs of
shares that do not meet the requirements for exemption are of no relevance up to the non-taxable amount of
the dividends, or interim payments thereon, received in the thirty-six months preceding their
realisation/attainment. This provision (i) applies with reference to shares acquired in the 36 months
preceding the realisation/attainment provided that the conditions indicated in the foregoing points (c) and (d)
are met, but (ii) does not apply to parties who prepare their financial statements in accordance with 
Section Two
249
international accounting standards as indicated in Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of the European
Parliament and Council dated 19 July 2002.
In relation to capital losses deductible from business income, note that:
 pursuant to Article 1 (4) of Decree-Law no. 209 of 24 September, 2002, converted into law by Law no.
265 of 22 November, 2002 – capital losses totalling more than Euro 5,000,000, deriving from sales of
equity interests constituting financial fixed assets, realised (even as a result of more than one act of
disposition) beginning with the 2002 tax period must be reported by the taxpayer to the Revenue
Office. The reportable details of the notification, in addition to the deadlines and procedural specifics
thereof, are contained in the Revenue Office’s Order of 22 May 2003 (published in Official Gazette
no. 138 of 17 June 2003). In the event of a failure to provide the notification, or an incomplete or
inaccurate notification, the capital losses realised are not deductible for tax purposes. This reporting
obligation – as a result of the provisions of Article 1 (62) of Law no. 244 of 24 December 2007 – is
rendered inapplicable, starting with the 2008 financial year, to parties which prepare their financial
statements in accordance with international accounting standards as indicated in Regulation (EC) no.
1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council dated 19 July 2002.
 pursuant to Article 5 quinquies, paragraph (3), of Decree-Law no. 203 of 30 September, 2005,
converted into law, as amended, by Law no. 248 of 2 December 2005, capital losses and negative
differences greater than Euro 50,000.00, deriving from transactions carried out (even as a result of
more than one act of disposition) on shares or other securities traded on Italian or foreign regulated
markets, must be reported by the taxpayer to the Revenue Office. The reportable details of the
notification, in addition to the deadlines and procedural specifics thereof, are contained in the Revenue
Office’s Order of 29 March 2007 (published in Official Gazette no. 86 of 13 April 2007). In the event
of a failure to provide the notification, or an incomplete or inaccurate notification, the capital losses
realised are not deductible for tax purposes.
For certain types of company and under certain conditions, capital gains realised by the aforesaid parties
through stock sales also contribute towards forming the related net value of production, subject to the IRAP
regional income tax.
(iv) Entities referred to in TUIR Article 73 (1) (c) with their tax residence in Italy
Capital gains realised other than in the conduct of a business by non-commercial resident entities are subject
to taxation under the same rules as those provided for capital gains realized by individuals on equity interests
held other than as part of a business.
(v) Italian pension funds and UCITS.
Capital gains realised by Italian pension funds as indicated in Decree 252 and by UCITS subject to the rules
of Article 8 (1) - (4) of Legislative Decree 461/1997 (investment funds and SICAVs), through a sale of shares
for valuable consideration are included in the total accrued operating results for the year subject to substitute
tax at a rate of 11% for pension funds and 12.50% for UCITS.
Note, however, that starting 1 July 2011, a new regime for UCITS taxation will go into effect, under which –
instead of the substitute tax referred to at the rate of 12.5% of total accrued operating results for the year – a
12.5% source withholding will be applied at the time of any distribution of income, or on the difference
between the redemption or liquidation value of the units and the cost of subscribing or acquiring the same.
Such withholding shall represent either a partial payment or a tax depending on the legal nature of the
subscriber of the related units.
(vi) Real estate mutual funds
Pursuant to Decree-Law 351/2001, and as a result of the amendments made by Article 41 bis of Decree-Law
269/2003, beginning 1 January 2004, revenues (including capital gains deriving from stock sales) obtained
by real estate mutual funds established pursuant to Consolidated Finance Act (TUF) Article 37 and Article 14
bis of Law 86/1994 are not subject to income tax. Income deriving from participation in such funds is
generally subject to 20% source withholding tax.

(vii) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy but possessing a permanent establishment in the
country
With regard to non-resident parties which hold their equity interest through a permanent establishment in
Italy, such amounts contribute towards forming the income of the permanent establishment in accordance
with the tax regime provided for capital gains realised by companies and entities indicated in TUIR Article
73 (1) (a) and (b) which are resident for tax purposes in Italy. If the equity interest is unconnected with a
permanent establishment in Italy of the non-resident party, refer to the following paragraph.
(viii) Parties not having their tax residence in Italy and lacking a permanent establishment in the country
Non-Qualified Equity Interests
Capital gains, realised by parties not having their tax residence in Italy and lacking a permanent
establishment in the country (through which the equity interests are held), which derive from the sale for
valuable consideration of Non-Qualified Equity Interests in Italian companies traded on regulated markets
(such as the Issuer) are not subject to taxation in Italy, even if held there. For shareholders not resident in
Italy for tax purposes to whom the administered savings regime is applied, or who have opted for the
managed savings regime indicated in Articles 6 and 7 of Legislative Decree 461/1997, the benefit of
exemption is subject to submission of self-certification attesting to the lack of tax residence in Italy.
Qualified Equity Interests
Capital gains, realised by parties not having their tax residence in Italy and lacking a permanent
establishment in the country (through which the equity interests are held), which derive from the sale for
valuable consideration of Qualified Equity Interests contribute to the formation of the payee’s taxable
income subject to personal income tax (IRPEF) or corporate income tax (IRES), depending on the nature of
such party, in accordance with the same rules as those provided for individuals not engaged in the conduct of
a business. Such capital gains are taxable only when the annual income declaration is made since they cannot
be subject either to the administered savings regime or managed savings regime. This is in any event without
prejudice to the application (where applicable) of the provisions of international dual-taxation conventions.
D. Fee for stock exchange contracts
Pursuant to Article 37 of Decree-Law no. 248 of 31 December 2007, converted into law by Law no. 31 of 28
February, 2008, the fee for stock exchange contracts indicated in Royal Decree no. 3278 of 30 December
1923 has been abolished.
E. Inheritance and gift tax
Decree-Law no. 262 of 3 October, 2006, converted into law, as amended, by Law no. 286 of 24 November,
2006, instituted the inheritance and gift tax on transfers of property and rights causa mortis, gifts or
gratuitous transfers, as well as on the creation of restrictions on intended use. For all matters not provided for
by paragraphs 47 - 49 and 51 - 54 of Article 2 of Law no. 286 of 2006, the provisions of Legislative Decree
no. 346 of 31 October, 1990, in the version in effect on 24 October, 2001, shall apply as compatible.
For resident parties, the inheritance and gift tax is applied on all property and rights transferred, wherever
existing. For non-resident parties, the inheritance and gift tax is applied exclusively to property and rights
existing in the territory of Italy. Regarded as existing in Italian territory, in any event, are shares of
companies which have their registered office, administrative office or principal purpose in Italy.
a) Inheritance tax
Pursuant to Article 2 (48) of Law no. 286 of 24 November, 2006, transfers of property and rights causa
mortis are subject to inheritance tax, at the following rates, to be applied to the total net value of the
property:
(i) for property and rights transferred to a spouse and relatives in the direct line, the share is 4%, with a
Euro 1,000,000 exemption for each beneficiary; 
Section Two
251
(ii) for property and rights transferred to other relatives up to the fourth degree of kinship and to affines in
the direct line, as well as to affines in the collateral line up to the third degree of kinship, the rate is 6%
(with an exemption of Euro 100.000 for brothers and sisters only);
(iii) for property and rights transferred to other parties, the rate is 8% (with no exemption).
If the beneficiary has a handicap recognised as serious within the meaning of Law no. 104 of 5 February,
1992, the inheritance tax shall be applied only to that portion of the value of the share or bequest in excess of
Euro 1,500,000.
b) Gift tax
Pursuant to Article 2 (49) of Law no. 286 of 24 November, 2006, for gifts and deeds which gratuitously
transfer property and rights and for the creation of restrictions on the intended use of property, gift tax shall
be determined by applying the following rates to the total value of the property and rights, less charges with
which the beneficiary is encumbered, or if the gift is made to more than one party jointly or if one and the
same deed includes multiple acts of disposition in favour of various parties, to the value of the attributable
shares of property or rights:
(i) for gifts or gratuitous transfers to a spouse or relatives in the direct line, the gift tax shall be applied at
a rate of 4%, with a Euro 1,000,000 exemption for each beneficiary;
(ii) for gifts or gratuitous transfers to other relatives up to the fourth degree of kinship and affines in the
direct line, as well as affines in the collateral line up to the third degree of kinship, the gift tax shall be
applied at a rate of 6% (with an exemption of Euro 100.000 for brothers and sisters only);
(iii) for gifts or gratuitous transfers to other parties, the gift tax shall be applied at a rate of 8% (with no
exemption).
If the beneficiary has a handicap recognised as serious within the meaning of Law no. 104 of 5 February,
1992, the gift tax shall be applied only to that portion of the value in excess of Euro 1,500,000.

The UBI Shares are offered under option to all the Issuer’s shareholders and all the Bondholders and,
therefore, there are no dilutive effects in terms of percentage stake in the Issuer’s fully diluted share capital
(calculated assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds and full subscription of the Capital Increase)
vis-à-vis the Issuer’s shareholders and the Bondholders who decide to subscribe to the Offer to the extent of
their entitlement. On the other hand, with reference to the percentage stake in the actually issued share
capital, the shareholders who decide to subscribe to the Offer for their entire entitlement, shall in any event
experience a maximum dilution of 2.12% should all or part of the Bondholders decide to subscribe to the
Option Rights assigned to them.
The Issuer’s shareholders who by contrast decide not to subscribe the Offer for the portion they are entitled
to, could see their stake in the actually issued capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around 29.12%.
On the other hand, considering the stake in the fully diluted capital (calculated, with reference to the situation
prior to the Offer, assuming full conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the basis of the current conversion
ratio and, with reference to the post-Offer situation, assuming full subscription of the Capital Increase), the
shareholders and the Bondholders who decide not to subscribe to the Offer for the portion of their
entitlement could see their stake in the fully diluted capital diluted by a maximum percentage of around
27.59%.

(*) Ratings for long-term debt refer to senior indebtedness.
(1) Capacity for repaying debt with a duration of under 1 year (A-1: best rating – D: worst rating).
(2) With reference to debts lasting longer than a year, this indicates the capacity for payment of interest and principal, along with any sensitivity to
the unfavourable effects of changed circumstances or a change in economic conditions (AAA: best rating – D: worst rating).
(3) Capacity for repaying short-term debt in local currency (maturity of less than 1 year). (Prime -1: highest quality – Not Prime: speculative grade).
(4) Capacity for repaying long-term debt in local currency (maturity equal to or greater than 1 year). Using the JDA (Joint Default Analysis)
methodology, this rating adds to the Bank Financial Strength Rating an evaluation of the probabilities of an intervention, when necessary, by
outside support (shareholders, the group to which the entity belongs, or official institutions) (Aaa: first quality – Baa3 medium quality).
(5) Bank Financial Strength Rating: This rating does not refer to the capacity for repaying the debt, but takes the bank’s intrinsic financial strength
into account (by analysing factors like territorial organisation, diversification of activities, financial fundamentals), in the absence of outside
support (A: best rating – E: worst rating).
(6) Capacity for repaying short-term debt (less than 13 months’ duration) (F1: best rating – D: worst rating).
(7) Capacity for meeting long-term financial commitments on time, regardless of the maturity of individual obligations. This rating is an indicator of
the probability of the issuer’s default (AAA: best rating – D: worst rating).
(8) Bank Individual Rating:Evaluation of the bank’s intrinsic strength (profitability, soundness of balance sheet, commercial network, management
capacity, operating context and outlook), viewed on the assumption the bank cannot rely on outside forms of support (possible intervention by a
lender as last resort, support from shareholders, etc.) (A: best rating – E: worst rating).
(9) Judgement of the eventual probability, adequacy and timeliness of outside intervention (on the part of the State or reference institutional
shareholders)in the event the bank should find itself in difficulty (1: best rating – 5: worst rating). 
Section Two
263
In particular, on 23 April 2010, as part of a general analysis of Italian banks, Standard & Poor’s confirmed
the short and long-term counterpart rating for UBI Banca, downgrading the outlook from Stable to Negative
in relation to a perceived lower capacity of the Group to absorb higher than expected credit losses in the
event of a faltering of the fragile economic recovery. On 6 May Standard & Poor’s confirmed the short-term
counterparty rating as A-1 and long-term counterparty rating as A, with a Negative outlook.
On 17 December 2010, Fitch Ratings reduced the long-term counterpart rating of UBI Banca from A+ to A,
with a Stable outlook, confirming all the other ratings. The action was taken in consideration of the
slowdown in economic activity in Italy and the persistent low level of market rates which, in the ratings
agency’s opinion, make a rapid recovery in UBI Banca’s operating profitability unlikely. At the same time,
Fitch confirmed: the importance of the Group’s franchise, located in the wealthiest regions of Italy; the sound
management and perception of credit risk, which has permitted loan quality to deteriorate to a lesser extent
than other competitors; the adequate capitalisation in relation to the conservative approach to risk; as well as
the adequate liquidity, with well diversified funding sources. As a consequence of the manoeuvre, the ratings
on the outstanding issues (Senior debt, Lower Tier 2 and hybrid securities) were reduced by a notch.
In this regard, the rating’s historical performance has therefore not had any significant impact on the Group’s
funding costs.
